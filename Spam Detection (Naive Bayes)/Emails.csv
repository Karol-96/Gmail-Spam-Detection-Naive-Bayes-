It’s Nvidia’s world, and we’re all just living in it. The chip giant turned in yet another “flawless” earnings report this week. But is it enough to quiet fears that AI advancements are finally starting to level off?

##### **TODAY IN AI**

**1. Would you trust your AI clone to make decisions for you? **The idea might not be so far-fetched, according to a [study](https://www.technologyreview.com/2024/11/20/1107100/ai-can-now-create-a-replica-of-your-personality/) from Stanford and DeepMind. Researchers interviewed 1,000 participants, then created digital replicas of them. The AI doppelgängers responded identically 85% of the time. The study’s author says it won’t be long before “you can have a bunch of small ‘yous’ running around and actually making the decisions that you would have made.” 

**2. Alphabet’s on a roll: **A week after the experimental Gemini-Exp-1114 shot to the top of the Chatbot Arena rankings, it’s been [unseated](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/models/experimental-models) by none other than…a different Gemini model, named 1121 after its release date. Alphabet says the update, which is only available to developers for now, features improved coding, reasoning, and vision capabilities. It wasn’t kidding: Exp-1121 is now ranked #1 across each of those categories.

**3. OpenAI’s feeling the heat as rivals chip away at its lead: **In 2023, the Sam Altman-led startup accounted for half of the enterprise AI market. This year, it makes up just over a third. That’s welcome news for Anthropic, which doubled its market share to 24% this year. Meta’s results were a wash, remaining steady at 14%. Overall, companies’ AI spending [swelled](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/11/20/business-spending-on-ai-surged-500percent-this-year-to-13point8-billion-says-menlo-ventures.html) 500% this year compared with 2023.

**4. But OpenAI could start chipping away at Alphabet’s lead soon:** The ChatGPT maker is reportedly thinking about [launching](https://www.theinformation.com/articles/openai-considers-taking-on-google-with-browser) its own browser, a move that would threaten Alphabet. The news comes at a particularly sensitive time for Alphabet, as the US Department of Justice wants the company to sell its Chrome browser in order to end its monopoly in the search business.

Claude recently released a new prompt improver that takes an existing prompt and refines it with prompt engineering techniques like chain-of-thought reasoning. Here’s how to use it:

* Go to Anthropic’s [Console](https://console.anthropic.com/dashboard) and sign up/log in to your account.

* Select the ‘**Improve an existing prompt**’ option to access the prompt optimizer.

* Add a sample prompt template and describe how you'd like to improve it.

* In the template, you’ll need to have at least one {variable}. These are placeholder values that you can replace and reuse in your prompts.

Sample prompt: Create a draft to learn about the topic {enter variable} 

Prompt for ‘**What would you like to improve**’ section: Make the output detailed

* Now select ‘**Improve Prompt**’, and click on ‘**Open in Workbench**’ to replace **{variables}** with your custom details.

* Click ‘**Run**’ once your prompt is ready and you’re done

## Nvidia’s earnings report sends ripples through the industry

The world’s most valuable company beat expectations Wednesday with an earnings report so [flawless](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/flawless-wall-street-analysts-cheer-nvidias-latest-blowout-earnings-report-185215421.html) one analyst said it “should be framed and hung in the Louvre.” 

**The company is getting ready to launch Blackwell**, a new generation of AI chips, and demand is through the roof. It nearly doubled its revenue compared with last year, and its market cap is now higher than the GDPs of Brazil, Italy, and Canada. 

**While everything’s coming up roses for Nvidia, there’s still a lot of uncertainty in the air:** Over the past couple weeks, major players like OpenAI and Alphabet have reportedly started running into a problem. Their latest models aren’t improving at the same rate, no matter how much compute they throw at them. 

**So there’s a lot riding on Nvidia’s success.** With about 94% of the AI GPU market under its wing, the company is confident its chips are the key to helping companies push past current limitations. As CEO Jensen Huang put it, “the age of AI” is upon us.

The big story


Advice for Trump


One of Wall Street’s most powerful people offered advice to the 
president-elect.



Ken Griffin, the billionaire founder of the $65 billion hedge fund Citadel, 
called for some restraint from Donald Trumpregarding policies implemented 
around immigration and inflation 
<https://www.businessinsider.com/ken-griffin-advice-trump-treasury-secretary-tax-cuts-policies-2024-11>
, write Business Insider’s Bradley Saacks and Michelle Abrego.



While speaking Thursday at the Economic Club of New York, Griffin said he 
appreciates the importance of those issues to Americans but said aggressive 
tactics to address them could make things work.



Griffin is one of the biggest donors to the Republican party, but declined to 
publicly endorse either presidential candidate this year.



Moderation hasn’t been the name of the game for Trump with some of his 
proposed policies. The president-elect promised mass deportations of immigrants 
in the US illegally and wide-ranging tariffs of at least 10-20% on all imported 
goods.



Griffin said the US should remain a place for ambitious immigrants to find 
work and warned cutting taxes poses a risk for a government holding so much 
debt.



At a conference just a few blocks away, Pimco CEO Manny Roman also raised the 
issue of taking a tough stance on immigration amid a tight labor market.



Griffin’s advice for Trump didn’t stop at his policies. He also made a 
suggestion for the future president’s all-important Treasury secretary pick:
Apollo CEO Marc Rowan 
<https://www.businessinsider.com/apollo-without-ceo-marc-rowan-donald-trump-treasury-secretary-2024-11>
.



""Please take the job,"" Griffin said of Rowan.

 
<https://www.businessinsider.com/ken-griffin-advice-trump-treasury-secretary-tax-cuts-policies-2024-11>

Alexander Tamargo


Griffin also might be looking for some advice.



He said he’d be open to selling a minority stake in his hedge fund 
<https://www.businessinsider.com/ken-griffin-would-consider-selling-stake-in-citadel-2024-11>
 to the right partner.



While Citadel still operates as a private partnership, Griffin sold a stake 
worth more than $1 billion in sister company Citadel Securities in 2022 to VC 
firms Sequoia and Paradigm.



The relationship has been a massive success, according to Griffin, with the 
two firms helping Citadel Securities with “real insights” into managing its 
rapid growth. Almost a quarter of all US equity market volume is handled by 
Citadel Securities.



Hedge funds selling off stakes of their firm are having a bit of a moment 
these days. Millennium Management, another multistrategy giant in the hedge 
fund world, is reportedly in early talks to get an investment from BlackRock.

device Musk has compared to a “FitBit in your skull,” posted multiple 
manufacturing job listings on its website this week. A professor of operations

most-streamed sporting event of all time, a net positive for Netflix’s 
livestreaming ambitions. 



3. Trump’s tariff plans have some startup founders quaking. Hardware startups 
that rely on Chinese manufacturers are bracing for Trump’s trade impact, which

1. Meet the man making money for Tucker Carlson, Megyn Kelly, and Bari Weiss. 
Once upon a time, leaving a big network like Fox News spelled the end of a 
career for commentators. Not so much anymore. BI’s Peter Kafka interviewed 
Chris Balfe, the man who helped TV news stars find audiences online,about the 
TV-to-internet transition

2. Auto workers face a wipeout. Major automakers around the world have 
recently announced layoffs and factory closures, including Ford, GM, 
Stellantis, and Volkswagen. They’re struggling to turn a profit on EVs and
facing a potential onslaught of cheaper competition

3. TGI Failure. It was once a singles bar and then a family-friendly 
restaurant. Now TGI Fridays is a place that nobody really wants to go. The 
company closed 36 restaurants at the start of the year and recently filed for 
bankruptcy.But TGI Fridays’ fall from grace

6,Digital Mentor: How to Make ₹8.4 Crores ($1M) a Year,Digital Deepak <digitaldeepakblog@substack.com>,"Fri, 22 Nov 2024 07:01:14 +0000","View this post on the web at https://blog.digitaldeepak.com/p/digital-mentor-how-to-make-84-crores

I started launching courses in 2016. I started with small courses that had 5-10 recorded video tutorials. I added them to a simple learning management system and started collecting payments for them using online payment gateways like Instamojo.
I generated leads via Facebook and Google Ads, nurtured them through my email drip marketing sequence, and sent them to a sales page to buy my course. Then, slowly, I upgraded to sales webinars, where I delivered the sales pitch.
However, one thing that disturbed me was that people were not completing the courses they were enrolling for. And just watching the video completely doesn't mean they have implemented what they've learned either. Without getting the students to learn what they've enrolled in, I realized I couldn't take them to a higher-level program with more rigor and results.
That's when I decided to move to the cohort-based course model. In 2019 I launched the first batch of the Digital Deepak Internship Program. We have trained more than 10,000 students in this program and we have a completion rate of as high as 80%. I have never looked back since.
Cohort-based courses are the future of online education because they try to replicate the best parts of an offline academic experience without the disadvantages of an offline training program.
Offline education experiences will never die, but a 3-month offline course to up-skill might not be the best use of the student's time.
In this article, let's focus on the benefits of cohort-based online courses.
Benefits of Cohort-Based Courses for Students
Since cohort-based courses deliver more value than an online self-paced course, they can command a higher price. In the day and age of increased CACs (cost per customer acquisition), having a higher entry price point is what will make digital mentors justify the time and effort in creating online education experiences.
Here are the reasons why Cohort-Based Courses deliver more value to students:
Start and End Dates: The cohort has a start and end date. And because of that, there is a feeling of accountability to finish what they've started. It resembles offline training experiences. People who miss enrolling in a specific cohort will look forward to the next cohort.
Student Communities: Cohort-based courses are built around communities. All the students who join a specific cohort make a community. They can interact with other students on an online forum, discord group, or a telegram channel. It doesn't matter what platform is used, as long as students have an opportunity to interact with each other. The group will be active even after your cohort ends, which is a good thing. They will form the ""alumni"" group for future cohorts.
Peer Support: Cohort-based courses usually have synchronization with the course progress with other students in the same group. This helps in peer-to-peer learning as people solve each other's doubts from the same week's lesson. Some students will be faster than others and they will help the slower students. Q&A sessions can be conducted by mentors and each session can have a specific theme to it in terms of content.
Evaluation: Cohort-based courses end with an exam or an evaluation test. Students like to compete with each other and look forward to a ranking so that they can figure out where they stand compared to other students of the same cohort. The people with top rankings get a huge validation for their extra efforts (even without having to give them incentives). ""The List"" has been important in education since the beginning of time.
Completion Rates: Due to the community-based learning environment, cohort-based courses usually have a higher completion rate than normal self-paced online courses. The students will come back to learn more only if they use what they have enrolled in. Customers need to be ""activated"" once they convert to retain them as a customers for the long term. You just don't sell the course. You've to sell them on the idea of why they should spend ""time"" consuming the course.
Live Interaction: Cohort-based courses allow live interaction with the mentor. Live interactions increase engagement, add the human element to the entire program, and remove the dullness and boredom that come with self-paced courses.
In our cohort-based programs, we create a community. We have general discussions, a place for posting memes, asking doubts (for every week), and announcements. Discord works perfectly well for us to handle communities. Each cohort has its own Discord channel/group.
The above listed are just some of the advantages that I can think of from the top of my mind. There is really no comparison between self-paced courses and cohort-based courses. The benefits of a cohort-based course far outweigh self-paced courses.
Pricing Cohort-Based Courses
Based on my understanding of the online education market for the past decade, I can clearly see that there is a cap on the pricing of self-paced courses.
Just like books always retail around $10-$20 (with a few exceptions), no matter how life-changing the content is inside it, self-paced courses always retail around $50 to $200 with a few exceptions. Many courses even sell for $10 at marketplaces that are flooded with courses.
There is a cap on the price of such courses because there is a cap on the amount of value they can deliver. It's just access to content and nothing else. No mentoring, no community, and no motivation to finish the course. 
Just like most book buyers don't complete the books, most course buyers don't complete the course. What students want when they sign up for an education program is not information, but transformation.
Cohort-based courses are also a great way for creators to monetize their creative work. A creator who keeps posting videos on YouTube is not going to get far in terms of revenue. eBooks and Books can bring a bit more revenue but not that much. Courses are a bit more, but still not significant enough for the creator to make a living out of it.
Cohort-based courses sell for a much higher price point and the creator can expect to make a living out of it. CBCs can range anywhere from $500 to $10,000.
Let's do some simple math. Here are 5 ways to make a million dollars a year as a creator. At a $10,000 price point (believe me, there are plenty of courses at this price point), you just need 100 customers a year to reach a million dollars a year in revenue.
$10,000 Product x 100 Customers per year = $1,000,000 a year.
Even if the expenses (ads, tools, team) are as high as 50% of the revenue, $500,000 a year (in profits) is still an excellent income for an individual creator. 
That's along the same lines as Google/Facebook tech lead's salary. (10 months/yr: Assuming the creator takes a holiday for 2 months in a year)
If a million dollars per year looks too big for you, think 1/10th of it.
The numbers still look impressive. A $1,000 course needs just 100 customers for it to make $100,000 in revenue. That's just 10 customers for 10 months. To get 10 customers a month, you need 50-80 sales calls a month. 
$1000 Product x 100 customers a year = $100,000
For someone who posts content regularly on YouTube, getting 10 customers a month is extremely easy. That would be the best way to monetize content. 
With YouTube ads, one has to get a million views on a single video to make $1,000 to $2,000 from that video. And getting a million page views is extremely difficult.
Anyone, with descent expertise on a topic, can start digital mentoring and aim for 100 students a year, or 10 students a month (approx). That's as good as a full-time job salary for a skilled employee. There are plenty of niches for digital mentors (and I will write about them in another article).
Let's now look at what is the best way to structure a CBC.
How to Create a Kick-ass Cohort-Based Course
If you are looking to start your own Cohort-Based Course, the following method can be extremely useful for you.
This is the same method I followed to build my 3-month CBC into a cash cow. This structure helped me scale profitably to 10,000+ students (at a $200-$300 price point) within 2 years.
You are selling a service, but you can productize (and automate) your service to the highest extent possible.
First 3 Cohorts (Manual Value Delivery)
Identify pain points in your students. (It helps to have a community of potential students developed through your content before you launch your first cohort-based course).
Create a rough outline for 8-12 weeks: Most cohort-based courses are usually 2-3 months long. What are the students going to learn every week? Design the assignments for every week's learning module.
Enroll your first batch of students through your community: If you have a community of 500 people, you just need a 2% conversion ratio to get 10 people in. 10 students are more than enough for you to get the ball rolling.
Don't aim for perfection for the first 3 cohorts: The lack of structure in the program will be made up by your availability and individual attention to your students. It is chaos, but it's ok for a start.
Develop mind-maps, and slide decks, and present them to your students live. Start editing your content based on the questions that students ask. This will help you understand what most students want. 
There is no way to know that without presenting the topic to your student, in a live class. This is where the rubber meets the road and this is what most people will try to skip. Work with your students personally and solve their challenges in a group coaching format, or do personal mentoring. You might have to give them at least 2 to 3 personal calls during the program.
The first 3 cohorts are going to be messy and chaotic. Bite it and endure it. This chaos is required to build order later. (I teach this in my digital mentor program).
You will be doing one session per week which would be a content session and another session that would be a Q&A session. But it gets better after you complete the first 3 cohorts.
That's where automation comes in...
Cohorts 4,5 and 6 (Semi-Automated Value Delivery)
Once you have done the first 3 cohorts of your course for at least 30 students, you can start adding automation to your cohort-based course. This is the point where you remove yourself (at least partially) from the equation.
Record all the sessions. You have the mind maps and the presentations already in place. You know what your students want. Your recorded sessions will not make sense and they will have a good content-market fit.
However, you cannot automate it completely as your students might still want to have access to you and your expertise. Students can watch the recorded modules every week, and then they can interact with you live on a Q&A webinar. You can answer their questions in a group coaching format.
You are reducing your time commitment to one live Q&A session per week because your course module is now recorded.
Your lack of live coaching for the week's modules will be (and should be) made up through better-structured content. You can never get the structure right in the first go because you do not know what your students want and where their challenges are. 
That's why I recommend doing the first 3 cohorts live. You are becoming a better teacher and content creator through live training.
From the 7th Cohort (Fully Automated Value Delivery)
When you do the 4th, 5th, and 6th cohorts in a semi-automated way, you will discover the missing links in your content. Which is made up of your Q&A sessions and live interaction with the students.
For each week, you might be able to identify 5-10 questions that are being asked frequently. Now you can make 10-20 minute videos for each of these questions and add them along with your week's modules. This will act as a ""patch"" for the missing links in your course.
For example, in my cohort-based course, in Week 4, I teach people to set up their own website on the WordPress platform. Different students use different hosting providers to host their blogs and in the 4th Week's live Q&A session, I discovered additional questions that were unique to micro-cohorts of people within the cohort. 
I created short SOPs (Standard operating procedures) and tutorial videos for each of them. They become assets for a long time.
Once you have made this content, we are looking at:
8-12 weeks of main modules (each 1-2 hours long, sometimes 3-4 hours long based on the topic).
5-10 additional short videos for each week. Each video can be 10-20 minutes long depending on the question and its depth. Sometimes some questions can be answered in 5 minutes. These videos need not be as professional as your main videos as they are just answers to FAQs.
What you have made is a high-value intellectual property. However, the content is not going to get any life by itself. It has to be structured inside a CBC for students to derive value from it.
From the 7th cohort onwards, you cannot eliminate the need for live Q&A sessions completely. People will still have questions that will not fall under the additional Q&A videos you've made. There is still a service component required.
Instead of doing the Q&A sessions yourself, you can employ a mentor who can do the weekly Q&A sessions. Many students will ask questions that you have already made videos for. They would expect the mentor to ""spoon-feed"" it to them.
As long as the mentor points them in the right direction, it is enough. The mentor just needs to share the link from the FAQ video library you've made. The student will be satisfied. Think of it as a concierge service for the students.  
Your lack of live presence with the students will be compensated by the well-structured and A-class content that you've made.
You might think that students might not enroll if you are not available, but by the time you are launching your 7th cohort, believe me, you will have developed enough student results to increase the demand for the course. 
And what I've described above is the best way to scale your revenue and also deliver more value to more students at the same time.
Perpetual Monthly Cohorts
Once your course is ready, along with the FAQ videos, you can launch one new cohort every month, and assign a mentor to each cohort. Each mentor will handle a cohort for 2-3 months, and move on to the next cohort.
That's how I've been doing it for the last 30 batches. Every cohort has a new mentor who will handle the batch for 3 months. We comfortably enroll 100+ students in a single batch.
You might think that 100+ students are a lot for a single mentor to handle. But believe me, it is not. When the content is well-structured, many people might not even show up for the Q&A sessions. Their questions will be answered within the content you've made.
In the Q&A sessions which we now do bi-weekly, we would see around 30-40% of the total students show up live. For students who cannot show up live, we also let them ask their questions in a form and then answer them on the live webinar. The recording of the live webinar is available for them to watch at a later date.
Showing Up Live as a Digital Mentor
Just because you have made the content, made the FAQ videos, and assigned mentors for each batch, it doesn't mean that you can disappear completely (though you can you will be forgotten soon).
To make up for the lack of your live presence with students from the 7th cohort onwards, you can do a weekly live session and talk about something new in your topic and address the students of all the cohorts in a single live webinar.
You will have 3-4 concurrent cohorts running at any point in time and you can invite people from your old cohorts as well.
I do a live call for my students every week (usually Thursdays at 9 PM) and the live interaction with the students makes up for the lack of my presence in the weekly modules of the cohorts.
At this point, the only work that you need to do is do a live webinar for all your paid students once a week. The rest of your time can be allocated to your craft, creating more courses, and marketing yourself & your products.
Assignments, Rating, and Feedback
I would recommend that each week's module be accompanied by an assignment. We add the assignments in Google Docs and give the links to them in the LMS. Students can make a copy of the original doc and fill up the assignment. (In the future, we are planning to ship physical workbooks to students.)
Students can submit the assignment from inside the LMS and there is a back end for approving the assignments. The mentor manually reviews each assignment, gives a rating for the assignment, and also gives short feedback for improvement on the assignment.
We've built a custom LMS for this because we figured out no other LMS has these features. (Shortly, we might also make a SaaS product out of this LMS that we've built for ourselves).
Incentives for Assignment Completion
What made our CBC popular was the decision to give cash back for every assignment completed. Students get real money paid to their bank account for every assignment that is approved.
Whether you want to give cash or some other incentives to your students, I believe, gamification is important for increasing the completion rates of your students.
Instead of punishing students for not completing assignments (like in school), you can reward them for completing the assignments. It works like a reverse scholarship. The meritorious students can get a part (or full) of their training fee back if they prove themselves to be sincere students who take all the training modules (and their assignments) seriously.
Marketing Your Cohort-Based Course (Attracting Students)
I am sure that by now you are pretty convinced that you need to get into a CBC to increase your revenue, your next question probably is: how do I market my CBC and how do I ensure enough students enroll every month.
It involves the following steps:
Find Your Niche: Start creating content and create your personal brand as an expert in a niche (You need to learn how to do market research and how to position yourself as an expert).
Lead Magnets: Create walled content in return for contact details (lead magnets). You can create ebooks, courses, tools, templates, and so on. (You need to learn content creation).
Lead Generation: Drive traffic to your lead magnets and scale up your lead generation. (You need to learn traffic generation).
Lead Nurturing: Create follow-up emails to nurture your leads. (You need to learn email marketing automation).
Community Management: Build a community and interact with your community. Use the community to get to know your ideal student avatar. (You need to learn community management and trust building).
Discovery and Empathy: Have group calls and 1:1 calls with your community members. Understand their challenges and figure out how you can help them achieve their goals. (You need to learn how to probe for the right questions and diagnose your student's current state through empathy. This is very important before you learn how to sell to build trust with your students.).
Launch First, Build Next: Design your first live cohort-based course and get enrollments for your first course. (You need to learn how to persuade people, and sell via sales copy, sales webinars, and sales calls).
Create: Make recorded videos (You need to learn video production and editing specifically for courses).
Organize: Host your videos and your community (You need to learn what tools to use and how to use them).
Automate: Automate your business. Hire people to mentor your students. And hire people to do sales calls and sales webinars. (You need to learn how to hire, train, and get extraordinary results out of ordinary people).
I hope this article gave you a clear insight into how you can make $1,000,000 a year as a creator by moving to cohort-based courses. $1m/yr might take a few years, but even if you get to $100k/yr it is a good start.
There is a lot more to learn and this post might be a good inspiration and a starting point for you to take CBCs seriously.
Since I have already cracked how to make cohort-based courses and scale them with my digital marketing training program, I am planning to teach people how they can become digital mentors themselves. 
Cheers,
Deepak Kanakaraju

Hey Karol,

Wow, the responses to our last email were amazing! So many of you shared the five people you spend the most time with, and we
loved reading about your networks. 💬

From all your messages, one thing was clear: Some of you are surrounded by friends who lift you up, motivate you, and push you to
be better. 

That’s incredible! 

But we also heard from those who realised that certain friends do the opposite—they demotivate, hold you back, or keep you from
pursuing your dreams.

If you fall into that second group, here’s our honest advice: Sometimes, you need to make difficult decisions for the sake of your
growth. 

We suggest that when it comes to your professional life, you consider spending less time with people who drag you down. 

Instead, fill your circle with those who inspire you—or even turn to resources like books, educational YouTube videos, or podcasts
that uplift and motivate you.

All you need are people (or resources) that inspire, support, and push you to be your best. 🔥

Our own story might help you understand this better: There are three of us at 1ClubNepal—Udip, Mahesh, and Sanish. 

We have a simple rule: when one of us feels down or demotivated, the other two step in. We share positive words, remind each other
of our goals, and keep the momentum going. 💪

It doesn’t stop there…

…we do this with our entire team, too. 

If someone’s spirit is low, we work together to lift them up. The power of a supportive, driven community is something you can’t
afford to ignore.

That’s exactly the spirit we’ve built at 1ClubNepal.

At our upcoming second physical event, you’ll experience this firsthand. We’ll provide: 

✅ Personalised tips on how to build a circle that accelerates your career
✅ Practical exercises to boost your motivation and focus
✅ Networking opportunities with like-minded individuals who want to see you succeed

Don’t miss this chance to learn, connect, and grow. Be part of Nepal’s top 1%!

This week at AIport (a newsletter about global AI news which I often contribute to), we talked about Denmark’s new AI supercomputer, Gefion.
The project intends to serve as a more socially conscious model for investing in AI infrastructure.
From the way it’s been funded to the way it’s powered, Gefion challenges how we might measure “returns” on AI investments—is it short-term profits or long-term societal impact?

Let’s get to today’s issue now!
Simplify Python Imports with Explicit Packaging
Python lets us package a project by adding an __init__.py file inside a directory.
If you have ever been confused about the internal details of the __init__.py file, today’s issue with help.
Let’s understand!
Packaging in Python
Simply put, if a project is packaged, you can import stuff from it.
While Python 3.3+ provides Implicit Namespace Packages — a directory with modules is considered a package by default, it is still advised to create an explicit __init__.py file.
A couple of major benefits of doing this are that it helps in:
Explicitly specifying which classes/functions can be imported from the package.
Avoiding redundant imports.
Some terminology before proceeding ahead:
Module: A Python file.
Package: A collection of Python files in a directory.
Library: A collection of Packages.
Consider this is our directory structure (and we are using Python 3.3+):
train.py has a Training class.
test.py has a Testing class.
As we are using Python 3.3+, we can directly import the Training and Testing class in pipeline.py as follows:
While this will work as expected, the problem is that we have to explicitly import the specific class from each of the modules.
This creates redundant imports.
Defining the __init__.py file can simplify this.
Let’s see how.
As depicted above:
We first explicitly package the directory by creating an __init__.py file.
Next, we specify the imports directly in this file.
Now, instead of writing redundant imports, you can directly import the intended classes from the “model” package, as shown below:
In other words, specifying the __init__.py file lets you treat your package like a module.
This simplifies your imports.
Also, as discussed earlier, an __init__.py file lets you explicitly specify which classes/functions can be imported from the package, which, otherwise, will not be evident.
This simplifies things for other users of your project.
Isn’t that cool?

13,Distributed Caching: The Secret to High-Performance Applications,ByteByteGo <bytebytego@substack.com>,"Thu, 21 Nov 2024 16:30:32 +0000","View this post on the web at https://blog.bytebytego.com/p/distributed-caching-the-secret-to

The demand for high-speed, high-performance applications has skyrocketed in recent years. 
With users expecting real-time responses, especially in sectors like e-commerce, finance, gaming, and social media, even a few milliseconds of delay can lead to a poor user experience, potentially impacting customer satisfaction and revenue. 
One core technique to accelerate data retrieval and improve application responsiveness is caching. 
Caching works by temporarily storing frequently accessed data in a high-speed storage layer, often in memory. This allows applications to retrieve information faster than if they had to pull it from the primary database each time. A single cache node is often sufficient for smaller systems or applications with a limited user base to store and serve frequently requested data. 
However, as systems grow, this setup faces limitations. Relying on a single-node cache to serve large-scale, high-traffic applications can lead to multiple problems.
This is where distributed caching comes into play. 
Distributed caching involves spreading the cached data across multiple servers or nodes, allowing the cache to scale horizontally to handle large-scale applications. With a distributed cache, data is stored across multiple locations, meaning a single-node failure doesn’t compromise the entire cache, and the system can continue to serve requests seamlessly. 
In this article, we’ll explore the concept of distributed caching in depth. We’ll look at how it works, discuss its key components, and examine common challenges and best practices for implementation.
Why Distributed Caching?...

Only a couple years ago, you could spot AI-generated text and videos from a mile away. Now, we need detection software to help us figure out what’s real and what’s not. AI-generated songs might be on a similar path as Suno releases its most realistic music model yet.

##### **TODAY IN AI**

View image: (https://media.beehiiv.com/cdn-cgi/image/fit=scale-down,format=auto,onerror=redirect,quality=80/uploads/asset/file/479f9e7a-c4c1-44d5-a217-c9350a89988b/GettyImages-578680184__1_.jpg?t=1732131047)

**1. Sam Altman throws weight behind major Nvidia challenger:** If you’re looking for an ambassador for your startup, you’d be hard-pressed to find someone better positioned than OpenAI’s CEO. He’s acting as [matchmaker](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/altman-raises-funds-rain-ai-191128862.html) for chipmaker Rain AI, which is trying to land $150M in Series B funding next month. It’s a delicate dance: Nvidia’s chips are so powerful that AI execs can’t live without them — even as they make moves behind the scenes to boost its rivals’ prospects.

**2. Chinese startup shocks AI community with reasoning model: **AI chip bans haven’t stopped China’s DeepSeek from developing a model on par with OpenAI’s latest LLM across multiple benchmarks. Just like o1-preview, DeepSeek’s R1 uses chain-of-thought to “think” through complicated problems. Early users say it tends to block political content but can be easily jailbroken. You can see whether it passes the Strawberry test [here](https://chat.deepseek.com/).

**3. Pokémon Go is a treasure trove of AI data:** Instead of scouring the globe for AI data, SF-based Niantic realized a crowd-sourced solution was [hiding](https://arstechnica.com/ai/2024/11/niantic-uses-pokemon-go-player-data-to-build-ai-navigation-system/) right under its nose. The company’s AR game Pokémon Go asks players to collect virtual Pokémon hidden around the world. It’s now compiling those scans to build an AI app that can detect where you are using a single photo — helping you find your way through unfamiliar places.

Try pinpointing exactly why you love your favorite song so much. It’s probably some mix of the singer’s voice, the instruments, the lyrics, a catchy chorus — all combined to become something that’s more than the sum of its parts. 

**Trying to recreate those subtle touches with AI is no easy feat:** But with its fourth major [update](https://suno.com/blog/v4), the music generation platform Suno says it’s getting close. V4 introduces more “soulful” vocals, with things like grunts and breaths that add to the realism. Plus, it can now generate sharper lyrics and higher-fidelity audio.

**The update includes new tools to stimulate creativity:** For example, you can now build a song around your own phone recordings or an uploaded image — or work alongside Suno to brainstorm lyrics. V4 is only available to subscribers for now, but it’ll roll out to everyone else in the coming months.

The big story


Sale: All browsers must go


The Justice Department wants to put a “For Sale” sign on one of Google’s key 
assets.



The DOJ has asked the judge in its antitrust case against Google to force the 
tech giant to sell Chrome, its massively popular browser. Business Insider’s 
Hugh Langley and Lara O’Reilly have a full rundown on the recommendation andwho 
stands to benefit and lose 
<https://www.businessinsider.com/google-sell-chrome-search-winners-losers-doj-2024-11>
.



Let’s break it all down:



The government is forcing Google to break up? What in the late 90s Microsoft 
is going on?Sort of. In August, a judge ruled Google violated antitrust laws 
and acted as a monopoly when it came to its search engine. Now the DOJ is 
recommending how it should be punished, and it wants Chrome gone.



So that’s it? Not even close, buddy. Google will have a chance to respond next 
month with its own plan before the judge makes a ruling next year. Even then, 
Google will likely fight any decision, delaying the process a few more years.



Ok, but in the meantime, what does the DOJ’s recommendation mean for Google? 
It’s certainly a blow. Chrome holds a majority of the US browser market share 
(61%). That makes it a powerful distribution arm for Google since Chrome’s 
default search engine is … Google. In short, Chrome sends a ton of search data 
and traffic Google’s way that it can leverage in a number of ways.



So is Google screwed? Not quite. This is still one of the largest and most 
powerful tech companies in the world. Losing out on three billion monthly 
Chrome users won’t be painless, but it has other ways to collect data and 
traffic (Gmail, YouTube, etc.) An adtech executive described losing Chrome to 
Hugh and Lara as “a manageable inconvenience” for Google.



What about Chrome? That’s a more complicated question. For a sale, Chrome’s 
valuation is difficult to calculate considering how deeply intertwined it is 
with Google (a Bloomberg analysis put it at anywhere from $15 billion to $20 
billion). And, from a financial perspective, it’s not clear if it could even 
operate independently.



Is this good news for anybody? Advertisers and search rivals are probably 
pumped. Many feel they were negatively impacted by Google’s monopoly. There’s 
already been chatter about a class-action lawsuit from advertisers that could
seek more than $100 billion in damages 
<https://www.businessinsider.com/google-artificially-raised-ad-prices-could-cost-it-100-billion-2024-9>
.



How’s the rest of Big Tech feeling? Probably not great. As much as they all 
compete for customers, none of them want to see more regulation. And Apple was 
making at least $20 billion a yearby defaulting to Google Search 
<https://www.businessinsider.com/google-antitrust-apple-search-payments-iphone-2024-11>
.



Wait. Is any of this even going to happen considering the change in 
administration?It’s the elephant in the room. The original antitrust complaint 
was filed under then-President Donald Trump. And Matt Gaetz, Trump’s pick to 
run the DOJ, has a history ofgoing after Big Tech 
<https://www.businessinsider.com/matt-gaetz-criticism-big-tech-trump-attorney-general-antitrust-2024-11>
. But his confirmation for the role is far from guaranteed, to say the least.

1.  What life after Marc Rowan could look like at Apollo. The PE giant’s CEO 
is reportedly in the running to be Treasury secretary under President-elect 
Donald Trump. A stock-research analyst who covers Apollo said its copresidents, 
Scott Kleinman and Jim Zelter,could take over the top spot, or even share it 
<https://www.businessinsider.com/apollo-without-ceo-marc-rowan-donald-trump-treasury-secretary-2024-11>

2. Making AI dreams come true. As Morgan Stanley’s head of firmwide AI, Jeff 
McMillan’s ultimate goal is for the technology to be ingrained into workers’ 
everyday lives. To achieve this,he’s devised a multi-step process 
<https://www.businessinsider.com/how-morgan-stanley-ai-leader-vets-new-solutions-2024-11>
 that begins with employees pitching their AI solutions and ends with getting 
it into production. 



3. The other stocks doing well since Trump won. You’ve likely heard about the 
‘Trump trade’ that’s sent stocks like Tesla soaring.But these under-the-radar 
companies 
<https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/under-the-radar-stocks-donald-trump-election-win-hsic-fox-2024-11>

1. Nvidia smashes earnings expectations, but investors still want more. The AI 
giant reported third-quarter revenue at a little more than $35 billion on 
Wednesday,beating analysts’ expectations by nearly $2 billion 
<https://www.businessinsider.com/nvidia-stock-earnings-report-call-live-updates-2024-11>
. But that wasn’t enough for investors — and its stock was down more than 3% in 
pre-market trading early Thursday. 



2. Google and YouTube built a “mind-blowing” music AI tool that never saw the 
light of day. Orca, a collaboration between Google’s DeepMind and YouTube, 
could generate an authentic-sounding song when prompted with just a few simple 
prompts, sources told BI. But the project ran up against major copyright risks,
forcing Google to shelve it

This is our a new newsletter format about the latest happenings at the intersection of creativity and AI…
BEN AFFLECK ON AI AND MOVIE MAKING
A video of Ben Affleck opining [ https://substack.com/redirect/a8263514-ef29-406b-abad-4ce79ad868b7?j=eyJ1IjoiMjQybjE3In0.nnbDVVySFRNCz5hdGhUxTBrs1nlgYhEL64dfJdVh0WY ] on the future of AI in film making blew up on X, in it Affleck says that AI isn’t going to replace film-makers, saying:
“movies will be one of the last things, if everything gets replaced, to be replaced by AI.”
What he did say was that AI film making would lower the barrier to entry for film-making: 
“What AI is going to do is dis-intermediate the more laborious, less creative, and more costly aspects of filmmaking that will allow costs to be brought down, that will lower the barrier to entry, that will allow more voices to be heard.” 
This reminded us of a great clip [ https://substack.com/redirect/16ded40d-ec58-4824-b76b-91ac367dcbae?j=eyJ1IjoiMjQybjE3In0.nnbDVVySFRNCz5hdGhUxTBrs1nlgYhEL64dfJdVh0WY ] of Affleck in 2003 when asked for his take on how the internet and file sharing would impact the movie industry -  he’d go on to predict annual subscription based on demand entertainment like Spotify and Netflix, saying: 
""I think an annual subscription-based system is one that works, It will be movies on demand but it will be a tiered structure""
COCA-COLA AI HOLIDAY ADVERT
Coca Cola released its Christmas advert, this year generated using AI [ https://substack.com/redirect/de263247-c53a-4bc9-8f5b-ff2d7920a1f7?j=eyJ1IjoiMjQybjE3In0.nnbDVVySFRNCz5hdGhUxTBrs1nlgYhEL64dfJdVh0WY ]. This unsurprisingly irked those opposed to AI image generation… leading to headlines about ‘controversy [ https://substack.com/redirect/f7cc8cd6-a8c0-401c-84bb-8e0c431b39d3?j=eyJ1IjoiMjQybjE3In0.nnbDVVySFRNCz5hdGhUxTBrs1nlgYhEL64dfJdVh0WY ]’ triggered by the ad.
“Coca Cola using ai for an ad is genuinely so terrifying to me. Art is dying.” [ https://substack.com/redirect/0f555426-a8c4-4553-b9c1-707df73d5e79?j=eyJ1IjoiMjQybjE3In0.nnbDVVySFRNCz5hdGhUxTBrs1nlgYhEL64dfJdVh0WY ] - @KJBurbankVA [ https://substack.com/redirect/f8ac920e-345d-4892-b6c3-65fdd90e7652?j=eyJ1IjoiMjQybjE3In0.nnbDVVySFRNCz5hdGhUxTBrs1nlgYhEL64dfJdVh0WY ]
A note on the ad says ‘created with ‘Real Magic AI’ - Coca-Cola’s own AI system - leading us to think, some kind of Christmas themed branded content creation app may be in the works. The AI generated Ad might well be a ploy to court controversy - as free marketing. All publicity is good publicity as they say… 
Could this be the start of a new trend in AI ‘outrage marketing’ - where brands deliberately antagonize the anti-AI crowd?
HarperCollins AI Deal
Giant publisher Harper-Collins has started to ask [ https://substack.com/redirect/0fb535f6-4304-41b1-9d85-89b9b2bf8765?j=eyJ1IjoiMjQybjE3In0.nnbDVVySFRNCz5hdGhUxTBrs1nlgYhEL64dfJdVh0WY ] its authors to opt-in to AI training systems from companies it is working with - offering a flat fee to authors of $2,500 - it seems this wasn’t [ https://substack.com/redirect/0fb535f6-4304-41b1-9d85-89b9b2bf8765?j=eyJ1IjoiMjQybjE3In0.nnbDVVySFRNCz5hdGhUxTBrs1nlgYhEL64dfJdVh0WY ] enough to avoid backlash…
Earlier this year HarperCollins announced [ https://substack.com/redirect/d3548951-f57c-45a7-9761-970674f1f059?j=eyJ1IjoiMjQybjE3In0.nnbDVVySFRNCz5hdGhUxTBrs1nlgYhEL64dfJdVh0WY ] a deal with ElevenLabs to create audiobooks for foreign translations it wouldn’t otherwise have made. 
This is an important reminder that AI will likely do more things that wouldn’t have otherwise been done, than it will replace things already done by humans - stuff like creating foreign language audiobooks, will increase the reach and sales of authors work. This will of course require authors give permission that their work be fed into AI systems.

Thanks for reading!
[IN CASE YOU MISSED IT] A crash course on building RAG systems (Part 1-3) [ https://substack.com/redirect/7d5d9597-1079-408a-9b8d-10265b88e7a9?j=eyJ1IjoiMjQybjE3In0.nnbDVVySFRNCz5hdGhUxTBrs1nlgYhEL64dfJdVh0WY ]​ [ https://substack.com/redirect/ae92e9f7-ca78-4d00-94cd-2ac25c0ae1ff?j=eyJ1IjoiMjQybjE3In0.nnbDVVySFRNCz5hdGhUxTBrs1nlgYhEL64dfJdVh0WY ]
Over the last few weeks, we have spent plenty of time understanding the key components of real-world NLP systems (like the deep dives on ​ [ dailydoseofds.com/bi-encoders-and-cross-encoders-for-sentence-pair-similarity-scoring-part-1 ]bi-encoders and cross-encoders [ dailydoseofds.com/bi-encoders-and-cross-encoders-for-sentence-pair-similarity-scoring-part-1 ]​ [ dailydoseofds.com/bi-encoders-and-cross-encoders-for-sentence-pair-similarity-scoring-part-1 ] for context pair similarity scoring).
RAG is another key NLP system that got massive attention due to one of the key challenges it solved around LLMs.
More specifically, if you know how to build a reliable RAG system, you can bypass the challenge and cost of ​ [ https://substack.com/redirect/be435075-5626-48ec-b528-db55944dbfd9?j=eyJ1IjoiMjQybjE3In0.nnbDVVySFRNCz5hdGhUxTBrs1nlgYhEL64dfJdVh0WY ]fine-tuning LLMs [ https://substack.com/redirect/be435075-5626-48ec-b528-db55944dbfd9?j=eyJ1IjoiMjQybjE3In0.nnbDVVySFRNCz5hdGhUxTBrs1nlgYhEL64dfJdVh0WY ].
That’s a considerable cost saving for enterprises.
And at the end of the day, all businesses care about impact. That’s it!
Can you reduce costs?
Can you drive more revenue?
Can you scale ML training/inference?
Can you predict trends before they happen?
Thus, the objective of this crash course is to help you implement reliable RAG systems, understand the underlying challenges, and develop expertise in building RAG apps on LLMs, which every industry cares about now.
We have published three parts so far:
Learn the foundations of RAG and build them from scratch in the first part here [ https://substack.com/redirect/e58112ec-b56a-4ee9-ba8f-c09be0c6fbec?j=eyJ1IjoiMjQybjE3In0.nnbDVVySFRNCz5hdGhUxTBrs1nlgYhEL64dfJdVh0WY ].​
Learn how to evaluate your RAG systems in the second part here [ https://substack.com/redirect/a730d009-b291-4c00-b2c2-3232446996ff?j=eyJ1IjoiMjQybjE3In0.nnbDVVySFRNCz5hdGhUxTBrs1nlgYhEL64dfJdVh0WY ].​
Learn how to optimize your RAG systems in the third part here [ https://substack.com/redirect/1896a666-fc50-484c-9d05-ff5d103420b7?j=eyJ1IjoiMjQybjE3In0.nnbDVVySFRNCz5hdGhUxTBrs1nlgYhEL64dfJdVh0WY ].​
Of course, if you have never worked with LLMs, that’s okay. We cover everything in a practical and beginner-friendly way.

32,This marketing strategy will help any business,Neil Patel <np@neilpatel.com>,"Wed, 20 Nov 2024 16:07:00 +0000 (UTC)","This marketing strategy is great for any business: big or small,
B2C or B2B.

It’s one of the best ways to generate interest, trigger
conversations, and increase revenue.

I'm talking about user-generated content, or UGC.

UGC is considered much more authentic and trustworthy.

* According to Stackla, 79% of people say it has a big impact on
their purchasing decisions.
* Millennials in particular put a lot of stake in UGC:
EveryoneSocial reports that they trust it 50% more than other
content created by brands.

UGC comes in many forms.

For a B2B brand, it could be testimonials and reviews on their
website.

For a B2C brand, it might be product photos or videos shared by
users on social media.

Here are the platforms where it works best:

)
To encourage users to create UCG, try the following tactics:

* Use strong calls-to-action
* Host a UGC competition
* Tap into influencer marketing
* Add your social media handles to packaging
* Create a brand hashtag

Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella’s hot take on this week’s scaling debate: There’s still plenty of room to keep climbing. He brought receipts, too, with a new tool that might make language barriers a thing of the past, plus a host of AI updates that could change the way you work.

**1. Figure’s humanoid robots just got 400% faster:** If you stop by BMW’s South Carolina plant, you’ll be greeted by an unexpected [sight](https://x.com/adcock_brett/status/1858876464458068275) — a fleet of autonomous robots moving parts on the production line. Figure CEO Brett Adcock said his startup’s three-month experiment has been a success, with a 7x boost in accuracy and a 4x speed jump. Next on the agenda: Delivering millions of them to households and workplaces.

**2. Quantum computers could hit the market next year:** Microsoft and computing company Atom just broke a [new record](https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/19/microsoft-and-atom-computing-will-launch-a-commercial-quantum-computer-in-2025/) by using lasers to hold 24 qubits in place at the same time. The breakthrough means quantum computers — which use the principles of quantum physics, like the idea that a piece of information can mean 0 and 1 at the same time — could arrive as soon as 2025, dramatically speeding up AI developments. 

**3. The battle for top AI talent gets more crowded: **Silicon Valley is already cutthroat enough, but now, Chinese tech companies like ByteDance are [heading there](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-11-19/china-s-chip-advances-stall-as-us-curbs-hit-huawei-ai-product) to look for top developers. For its part, Alibaba reportedly hired several OpenAI alums for a new Bay Area office. Chinese companies have felt pressure to venture abroad as the US clamps down on chip exports, making it harder to build AI products inside the country.

Working with The Bruery, we developed AI models that could predict taste scores and generate winning recipes — resulting in A.I.P.A., a West Coast Double IPA that beer enthusiasts can't stop raving about.

This isn't just a story about a great beer; it's about showing how AI can revolutionize product development in unexpected industries. At AE Studio, we help companies transform their data into groundbreaking innovations.

Extracting structured data from unstructured documents saves time and reduces errors. Here's how:

* Go to [Extracta AI](https://extracta.ai/), sign up, and open the **""Data Extraction""** tab.

* Click **""+ New extraction""** and choose a template (e.g., ""Resume/CV"") or select **""Custom Document""** for unique formats.

* Name your extraction, set the language, select document options, and click** ""Next"" **to proceed.

* Edit fields to match your document’s structure. You can add new fields or remove irrelevant ones.

* Adjust field types (e.g., String, List) and click** ""Next""** to save.

* Upload files, confirm, and wait for processing to finish.

* Review extracted data and download it as Excel, CSV, or JSON.

##### **FROM THE FRONTIER**

## How Microsoft plans to streamline your work with AI

The idea of having an AI personal assistant to do things for you sounds good — but when it comes to actually building one, a lot of us have no idea where to start. At its annual Ignite event, Microsoft [announced](https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2024/11/19/ignite-2024-why-nearly-70-of-the-fortune-500-now-use-microsoft-365-copilot/) new agents that can automatically jump into your workflow without much setup. 

They can take notes during meetings, analyze your documents, and summarize chats. But the coolest one might be an AI interpreter that automatically translates your speech into different languages while preserving your unique voice during video calls. 

Eric Boyd, Corporate VP, Azure AI Platform told Superhuman the updates are all about practicality: “Our ultimate aim is to help organizations connect advanced AI technologies with their real-world business needs and existing infrastructure.” 

**Here’s everything else announced: **

* An Azure update lets developers switch between LLMs so they don’t have to rebuild their apps each time a new model comes out

* Two new chips: One for speeding up computing inside data centers and one for security and encryption

* An AI-powered search feature for Copilot PCs lets you find things like “the photo of a red barn”

* A mini PC called Windows 365 Link runs entirely on the cloud

* A new and improved Recall feature (the one that can remember what you did online days or weeks ago) with beefed-up security

The big story


A juggernaut reports


Earnings season is wrapping up, but the stock market’s biggest member still 
needs to get a say.



Nvidia reports its much-anticipated third-quarter earnings after the bell 
today. It’s been a while since one company held so much sway over the stock 
market.



The Magnificent 7 member has become a party of one this year, far outstripping 
its peers in performance. Nvidia shares are up more than 200% this year, en 
route to becoming the world’s most valuable company.



But today’s earnings report is about what’s to come as opposed to what has 
been. Specifically, Wall Street wantsan update on the demand for Nvidia’s new 
Blackwell GPU 
<https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/nvidia-earnings-preview-wall-street-forecasts-blackwell-gpu-artificial-intelligence-2024-11>
, writes Business Insider’s Matthew Fox.



The highly anticipated chip is important for more than just Nvidia. As the 
world’s top provider of AI chips, demand for Blackwell is a bellwether for the 
industry’s appetite for continued investment in AI.



Blackwell’s arrival also coincides with questions about whether AI models are 
hitting a performance wall 
<https://www.businessinsider.com/agi-predictions-looking-stretched-openai-sam-altman-google-ai-2024-11>
.



Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang seemed to address some of those concerns on Monday. He 
said computing power — which plays a key role in helping AI models level up — 
was already seeinga “fourfold” increase annually 
<https://www.businessinsider.com/nvidia-jensen-huang-predicts-increase-computing-power-ai-scaling-2024-11>
.

 
<https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/nvidia-earnings-preview-wall-street-forecasts-blackwell-gpu-artificial-intelligence-2024-11>

Nvidia


Nvidia’s new chips won’t be foolproof, though.



The red-hot chips are literally red-hot. Reports of Blackwell chips 
overheating spooked the market earlier this week. BI’s Emma Cosgrove spoke to 
one of the top chip analysts,who said the issues are “overblown.” 
<https://www.businessinsider.com/nvidia-blackwell-chips-liquid-cooling-issues-2024-11>



Still, Blackwell customers need to invest in liquid cooling solutions to 
ensure they operate as efficiently as possible.



It’s another cost companies investing in AI chips need to consider in addition 
to the energy required to fuel them, which has been aheadache for tech giants 
<https://www.businessinsider.com/amazon-data-centers-delays-costs-power-labor-shortages-aws-ai-2024-10>
.



There’s also the fear that what you buy won’t last you long, as Nvidia has 
pledged to release a new chip every year. (Keeping that promise hasn’t been easy
 
<https://www.businessinsider.com/nvidia-ai-chip-blackwell-delay-new-annual-product-launch-2024-8>
.)



The aggressive product roadmap might be a win for Nvidia investors, but it 
poses problems for everyone else. The constant release of new, better chips 
could seriously strain budgets.



It complicates how firms account for their investments. A faster depreciation 
means customers won’t be able to spread out the cost of the chips across 
several years.


Some analysts are already taking notice. Barclays trimmed earning estimates 
next year by as much as 10% 
<https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/ai-stocks-risk-nvidia-gpus-blackwell-tech-outlook-depreciation-accounting-2024-8>
 for some of the biggest buyers of AI chips, like Meta, Amazon, and Alphabet.

1. Trump taps billionaire Howard Lutnick for commerce secretary. If confirmed, 
Lutnick, the CEO of Cantor Fitzgerald, will be in apivotal position to deliver 
on one of Trump’s campaign promises

: the economy.Here’s everything you need to know 
<https://www.businessinsider.com/howard-lutnick-billionaire-donald-trumps-commerce-secretary-nominee-cantor-fitzgerald-2024-11>
 about the New York financier. 



2. Tiger Management is beefing with one of the hedge funds it initially backed.
The late billionaire founder Julian Robertson seeded Hound Partners in exchange 
for a portion of the fund’s performance fees.Now both firms are suing each other
 
<https://www.businessinsider.com/julian-robertson-tiger-mamangement-hound-partners-lawsuits-2024-11>
. Hound’s lawsuit says Tiger hasn’t provided marketing assistance in recent 
years, which was part of the agreement. Tiger’s suit claims Hound is using 
Robertson’s death to get out of its agreement. 



3. A Goldman exec talks through the spike in corporate borrowing that signals 
the return of M&A.Companies raised over $50 billion in debt capital since 
Trump’s presidential victory last week. Vivek Bantwal, Goldman Sachs’ global 
head of financing, talked to BI about what’s fueling the surge andhow the bank 
is looking to compete in the debt market

1. Product managers: purposeless, or just misunderstood? Product managers 
began to populate Silicon Valley in the mid-2000s, and they’ve often drawn the 
ire of their coworkers. As the tech industry faces contraction, the usefulness 
of their roles is under scrutiny —as are their futures 
<https://www.businessinsider.com/product-managers-rule-silicon-valley-tech-industry-programmers-jobs-ceo-2024-11>
. 



2. Alexa needs an AI knight in shining armor. Amazon is trying to save its 
voice assistant with new generative-AI powers, but its rollout has been stumped 
by a slew of problems. Hiccups with partners like Uber and Ticketmaster, 
compatibility problems, and accuracy issues havedelayed the release of Alexa 2.0
 <https://www.businessinsider.com/amazon-save-alexa-with-ai-2024-11>. 



3. Google’s antitrust loss could cost Apple billions. Every year, Google pays 
Apple $20 billion to make Google the default browser on iPhones. That deal was 
the crux of a DOJ antitrust case Google lost earlier this year. The government 
is expected to ask a judge to ban those payments,but it might not be the end of 
the story

1. Trump’s cabinet could be the wealthiest in history. They could get richer 
in office. Some of Trump’s picks had long careers in the private sector where 
they earned billions of dollars. When they transition to the public sector, 
they can delay capital gains taxes on the assets they’re required to sellby 
taking advantage of a little-known loophole 
<https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-cabinet-deferred-capital-gains-tax-divest-2024-11>
. 



2. Out with the old, in with the new. X just signed a new adtech partner 
<https://www.businessinsider.com/x-signed-up-pubmatic-as-partner-to-sell-its-ads-2024-11>
 in hopes of boosting ad revenue, which has been down since Elon Musk’s 2022 
takeover. The platform also added a new defendant — the Amazon-owned streamer 
Twitch —to its lawsuit against advertisers 
<https://www.businessinsider.com/elon-musk-x-sues-twitch-advertising-boycott-lawsuit-2024-11>
, which it accuses of colluding to withhold ad spend. 



3. Career advice for government workers trying to dodge the DOGE. As the 
threat of government cuts loom, some career coaches told BI they’re already 
hearing from federal workers looking to beef up their résumés and explore the 
private sector.But they might have to tap into the “hidden job market.”

49,A Crash Course on Building RAG Systems – Part 3,Daily Dose of Data Science <avichawla@substack.com>,"Tue, 19 Nov 2024 19:49:55 +0000","View this post on the web at https://blog.dailydoseofds.com/p/a-crash-course-on-building-rag-systems-f42

Earlier this month, we started a crash course on building RAG systems.
Part 3 is now available, where we are building on the foundations laid in Part 1 and Part 2.
Read here: ​ [ https://substack.com/redirect/b1c83725-72d3-4477-82a4-850e08072f1a?j=eyJ1IjoiMjQybjE3In0.nnbDVVySFRNCz5hdGhUxTBrs1nlgYhEL64dfJdVh0WY ]A Crash Course on Building RAG Systems – Part 3 (With Implementation) [ https://substack.com/redirect/b1c83725-72d3-4477-82a4-850e08072f1a?j=eyJ1IjoiMjQybjE3In0.nnbDVVySFRNCz5hdGhUxTBrs1nlgYhEL64dfJdVh0WY ].
More specifically, in this part, we are looking at strategies that help us optimize RAG apps for real-world use cases:
Read here: ​ [ https://substack.com/redirect/b1c83725-72d3-4477-82a4-850e08072f1a?j=eyJ1IjoiMjQybjE3In0.nnbDVVySFRNCz5hdGhUxTBrs1nlgYhEL64dfJdVh0WY ]A Crash Course on Building RAG Systems – Part 3 (With Implementation) [ https://substack.com/redirect/b1c83725-72d3-4477-82a4-850e08072f1a?j=eyJ1IjoiMjQybjE3In0.nnbDVVySFRNCz5hdGhUxTBrs1nlgYhEL64dfJdVh0WY ].
Why care?
Over the last few weeks, we have spent plenty of time understanding the key components of real-world NLP systems (like the deep dives on bi-encoders and cross-encoders for context pair similarity scoring).
RAG is another key NLP system that got massive attention due to one of the key challenges it solved around LLMs.
More specifically, if you know how to build a reliable RAG system, you can bypass the challenge and cost of fine-tuning LLMs.
That’s a considerable cost saving for enterprises.
And at the end of the day, all businesses care about impact. That’s it!
Can you reduce costs?
Drive revenue?
Can you scale ML models?
Predict trends before they happen?
Thus, the objective of this crash course is to help you implement reliable RAG systems, understand the underlying challenges, and develop expertise in building RAG apps on LLMs, which every industry cares about now.
Of course, if you have never worked with LLMs, that’s okay.
We cover everything in a practical and beginner-friendly way.

Maintaining uptime during system upgrades or migrations is essential, especially for high-stakes, real-time platforms like Uber's trip fulfillment system. 
Uber relies on consistent, immediate responsiveness to manage millions of trip requests and transactions daily. The implications of downtime for a platform like Uber are scary: even a brief service interruption could lead to lost revenue, user dissatisfaction, and huge reputational damage.
However, Uber faced the daunting challenge of migrating its complex fulfillment infrastructure from an on-premises setup to a hybrid cloud environment. 
This task not only required a deep understanding of system architecture but also an approach that could guarantee zero downtime, ensuring that millions of riders, drivers, and partners worldwide would experience uninterrupted service during the transition.
In this article, we’ll look at Uber's zero-downtime migration strategy. We’ll also learn more about the technical solutions they implemented and the challenges they faced in the process.
The Complexity of Uber’s Trip Fulfillment Platform
Uber’s fulfillment system, before it migrated to a hybrid cloud setup, was designed to handle vast amounts of real-time data and high transaction volumes. 
At its core, the fulfillment system managed the interactions between millions of riders, drivers, couriers, and other service elements, processing over two million transactions per second. Some stats to describe the system’s importance are as follows:
The platform handles more than a million concurrent users and billions of trips per year across over ten thousand cities.
The platform supports billions of database transactions a day.
Hundreds of Uber microservices rely on the platform as the source of truth for the accurate state of the trips.
The architecture was organized into “pods”, where each pod was a self-contained unit of services dedicated to a particular city or geographic region. See the diagram below:
For reference, a pod is a self-sufficient unit with many services interacting with each other to handle fulfillment for a single city. Once a request enters a pod, it remains within the services in the pod unless it requires access to data from services outside the pod.
Within each pod, services were divided into “demand” and “supply” systems. The demand and supply services were shared-nothing microservices with the entities stored in Apache Cassandra and Redis key-value tables. 
The demand services managed rider interactions
Supply services handled driver operations.
These services stayed synchronized using distributed transactional techniques to ensure that trip-related data remained consistent within each pod. Uber employed the saga pattern for this.
Entity consistency within each service was managed through in-memory data management and serialization.
Architectural Limitations and Scalability Issues
The initial architecture was designed to prioritize availability, sacrificing some aspects of strict data consistency to maintain a robust user experience. 
However, as Uber’s operations expanded, these architectural choices created bottlenecks:
Eventual Consistency: The entire architecture was based on the thought process of trading off consistency for availability and latency. The lack of atomicity meant the need to reconcile when the second operation failed.
Multi-Entity Write Operations: When an operation had to write across multiple entities, the application layer handled this interaction using an RPC-based mechanism. The system had to constantly verify the expected and current states to fix mismatches.
Limited Scalability: The cities were sharded among one of the available pods and the size of the pod was dependent on the maximum ring size of a cluster. There was a vertical limit for scaling the pod if any of the cities crossed a threshold of concurrent trips.

The Redesigned Architecture
In the redesigned system architecture, the Uber engineering team shifted from a distributed, in-memory setup to a more centralized, cloud-backed infrastructure.
The new system consolidated the previously separate “demand” and “supply” services into a single application layer supported by a cloud database. By moving data management to a datastore layer, the new system streamlined operations and improved scalability and consistency.
See the diagram below to understand the new architecture:
Key Solutions Implemented By Uber
While designing the new solution had its share of the complexity, the real challenge was migrating the workload to the new design.
Some of the key solutions implemented by Uber’s engineering team to achieve zero downtime migration to the new system are as follows:
1 - Backward Compatibility Layer
Uber implemented a backward compatibility layer as a core component of its zero-downtime migration strategy. 
This layer served as a bridge, allowing existing APIs and event contracts to function normally while Uber transitioned to a new system architecture. By supporting the old API contracts and event schemas, the backward compatibility layer ensured that many internal and external consumers of Uber’s APIs could continue to operate without modification.
See the diagram below to understand the role of the backward compatibility layer.
Some of the benefits of the backward compatibility layer are as follows:
By keeping old API contracts intact, Uber avoided abrupt changes that could cause errors or service interruptions, ensuring a stable user experience throughout the migration.
Consumers could move to the new system at their own pace, enabling a gradual adoption of the new API endpoints without disrupting workflows.
The compatibility layer minimized the need for coordination across all API consumers, as teams could adopt the new system independently.
However, there were also some downsides to this:
Increased Complexity: Maintaining a compatibility layer added another source of complexity to the migration. Every API endpoint and event schema had to be kept consistent across both systems, leading to possible redundancy in data processing and storage.
Risk of Technical Debt: Continuing to support outdated APIs and event schemas can create long-term technical debt. If not carefully managed, the compatibility layer could lead to ongoing maintenance costs and slow down future development.
Performance Overheads: The compatibility layer could introduce performance overhead, as requests may need to be processed in both the old and new systems or converted to fit the new architecture. This can result in latency, especially in high-volume systems.
2 - Shadow Validation
Shadow validation was integrated into Uber’s high-transaction, real-time platform. 
Each request sent to the old system was mirrored in the new one, and responses from both were compared on a key-value basis. Discrepancies were logged and analyzed within Uber’s observability framework, with differences captured in a dedicated observability system for further examination. 
This comparison was not simply binary; Uber allowed for certain predefined tolerances and exceptions to accommodate unavoidable variances, such as transient data changes or slight delays due to processing orders.
When differences between systems arose, Uber took a two-fold approach:
Automated Logging and Alerts: Minor discrepancies within pre-approved tolerances were logged for further analysis but did not require immediate action. These were typically edge cases where slight timing differences or transient state mismatches occurred.
Manual Intervention for Critical Mismatches: If a response deviation posed a risk to user functionality or violated critical data requirements, the engineering team could prioritize it for immediate investigation. This step ensured that high-impact discrepancies were resolved quickly, reducing the chance of significant issues when the system went live.
Migration Phase
Let’s now understand how Uber carried out the migration.
1 - Pre-Rollout Preparations
Uber’s pre-rollout preparation steps were foundational to achieving a smooth, zero-downtime migration for their trip fulfillment platform. 
Each step, such as shadow validation, end-to-end (E2E) testing, load testing, and database warm-up, played a critical role in minimizing potential risks and ensuring the new system would perform reliably under real-world conditions.
Some of the key activities that were performed are as follows:
End-to-End (E2E) Testing
E2E testing enabled Uber to verify the complete functionality of the new system from start to finish. It was essential to identify potential integration issues or bottlenecks.
By simulating realistic user journeys, these tests checked that all workflows, integrations, and dependencies performed as expected under different scenarios.
Load Testing
Load testing subjected the new system to simulated traffic levels that matched or exceeded actual usage, evaluating its capacity to handle high transaction volumes without degradation.
Load testing confirmed that the new system could withstand Uber’s high operational demands, from peak traffic to unexpected surges. It allowed Uber to preemptively address any performance issues, such as latency or system overload, under stress conditions.
Database Warm-Up
Database warm-up involved generating synthetic data loads to pre-fill caches and split partitions, ensuring the database was primed for full production traffic from the start.
For Uber, whose cloud database had to handle rapid scaling, database warm-up prevented “cold-start” issues by ensuring that common queries and data partitions were already optimized for performance. This step reduced the chance of initial slowdowns or resource bottlenecks during migration.
2 - Traffic Pinning and Phased Rollouts
Uber employed a traffic pinning and phased rollout strategy to migrate specific trips incrementally to the new system to reduce the risk of inconsistencies 
This approach allowed Uber to gradually shift parts of its trip fulfillment platform to the new architecture.
Technical Process of Traffic Pinning and Phased Rollout
Traffic pinning ensured that each trip’s data was processed by a single system—either the old or the new—throughout its lifecycle. 
This was critical for preventing data fragmentation and ensuring consistent trip updates, as each trip involves multiple interactions, such as driver updates, route changes, and fare calculations.
To achieve this, Uber developed a routing logic to “pin” ongoing trips to the system where they were initiated. Before migration, consumer identifiers for riders and drivers were recorded, enabling Uber to route each interaction related to a given trip back to its origin system, preventing mid-trip transitions that could lead to data mismatches. 
This tracking persisted until the trip was completed, after which riders and drivers were gradually transitioned to the new system for future trips. 
The diagram below demonstrates the concept of traffic pinning.
Initially, Uber migrated less critical or idle riders and drivers to the new system, followed by active trips in specific cities. Over time, this phased approach allowed Uber to monitor and control the migration, expanding it to cover larger segments and eventually all active users.
The key benefits of traffic pinning are as follows:
Data Consistency: Traffic pinning ensured that all interactions for a specific trip remained in the same system, preventing data inconsistencies. This consistency is essential for real-time platforms where split-second updates are crucial to the user experience.
Reduced Risk of Errors: By phasing out migrations, Uber could control and monitor each stage, identifying potential issues in a manageable scope. If an error surfaced, Uber could isolate it to a specific set of users or regions, minimizing overall impact.
Increased Stability for Users: Due to this approach, trips in progress weren’t affected by system changes, reducing the likelihood of transaction failures or incomplete updates that could disrupt users.
Key Observability and Rollback Mechanisms
Uber developed detailed dashboards and monitoring tools to track metrics like trip volume, trip completion rates, driver availability, and overall system load. 
These dashboards provided visibility into performance and data consistency across both systems, allowing engineers to observe how traffic gradually drained from the old system while increasing in the new one. 
The goal was that the overall aggregate metrics should remain flat. Key metrics, including transaction success rates, latency, and error rates, were monitored at city-level granularity to catch any localized disruptions.
These observability tools also enabled Uber to spot irregularities in real-time. 
For example, if completion rates dropped in a specific city, engineers could quickly investigate and determine whether the issue originated from the new system. The tools flagged critical problems that could trigger a rollback for specific regions, allowing Uber to maintain stability while continuing the migration elsewhere.
The rollback mechanism was equally important. 
Uber could reverse traffic flow for any region back to the old system if metrics indicated significant deviations from expected performance. 
Conclusion
Uber’s zero-downtime migration approach highlights key technical strategies for complex, large-scale migrations. 
By implementing a backward compatibility layer, Uber maintained service continuity, allowing gradual, flexible transitions for its consumers. 
The shadow validation and traffic pinning techniques ensured data consistency and stability, while observability and rollback mechanisms provided real-time insights and controlled reversibility in case of issues. These strategies allowed Uber to minimize user impact while migrating critical components.
Despite its success, Uber’s approach faced challenges, such as the high infrastructure demand of maintaining dual systems and the complexity of managing large-scale observability.

Uncovered emails reveal OpenAI’s rocky early days: **Elon Musk’s lawsuit against OpenAI is bringing up [dirty laundry](https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/artificial-intelligence/musks-concerns-over-google-deepmind-ai-dictatorship-revealed-in-emails-from-2016-communications-released-during-the-recent-openai-court-case), including tense emails between the startup’s founders from 2015. At one point, Ilya Sutskever (who left OpenAI this year to found his own AGI-focused startup) said he didn’t trust Altman or Musk to be in charge. It’s now been a year since Sutskever tried to axe Altman — only for him to return as CEO days later.

For a while, it felt like AI models were on a steady upward trajectory — about as predictable as gravity itself. But a potential Nvidia production [snag](https://www.businessinsider.com/nvidia-blackwell-chip-ai-overheating-delay-share-price-2024-11) is bringing the industry back to reality.

Over the past couple weeks, everyone from Anthropic to Alphabet to OpenAI have expressed disappointment with their upcoming models. Most think the only way forward is to shore up bigger and more powerful clusters, with Elon Musk’s xAI trying to gather up 200,000 chips and Meta following close behind.

Nvidia’s next-gen Blackwell architecture already had a year-long waiting list — but a newly discovered server overheating problem could push back those deliveries even more. While it’s probably too early to lament the delay of GPT-5 (Nvidia told reporters there’s nothing to worry about) the hangup is a good reminder that even AI startups can’t escape the realities of the supply chain.

The big story


No more government guarantees


The hottest trend in Washington, DC, might be updating your résumé. 



Elon Musk’s government efficiency commission has been tasked with cutting 
government spending, raising questions about the future of millions of jobs.



Business Insider’s Ayelet Sheffey and Madison Hoff have a breakdown of the 
number of employees and salariesat different government departments 
<https://www.businessinsider.com/how-many-federal-government-jobs-pay-salaries-elon-musk-doge-2024-11>
.



The average compensation for most departments was over $100,000, with the 
Department of Education topping the list ($144,561). Veterans Affairs was the 
largest employer — 486,522 workers — and more than double the second-biggest 
department (Homeland Security’s 222,539 employees).



The specifics on how the Department of Government Efficiency will operate 
still aren’t clear, but Vivek Ramaswamy, who is co-leading DOGE with Musk, has 
saidentire federal agencies could be cut 
<https://www.businessinsider.com/vivek-ramaswamy-doge-wants-to-delete-entire-federal-agencies-2024-11>
.



That might sound drastic, but some of the biggest areas of government spending 
<https://www.businessinsider.com/elon-musk-vivek-ramaswamy-doge-government-efficiency-what-us-spends-2024-11>
 are a lot harder to touch.



Social Security ($1.46 trillion) and Medicare ($874 billion) are considered 
mandatory spending, meaning they don’t require congressional approval each year 
and would require a major legislative push to make cuts or other changes. Cuts 
made there could also kick off a firestorm from the general public.



Musk also isn’t a stranger to taking big swings that others doubt are 
possible. When he acquired Twitter and cut 80% of the staff, many predicted it 
was the end of the app. More than two years later it’s still running and the 
center of public discourse.



But eliminating entire departments comes with its own set of challenges 
<https://www.businessinsider.com/musk-ramaswamy-trump-doge-government-agencies-reform-2024-11>
, write BI's Alice Tecotzky and John L. Dorman. DOGE will likely operate as an 
advisory group, without the powers to enact changes itself, experts told BI.

Government jobs’ potential reckoning is happening after the public sector got 
a ton of attention this year.



Fed up with the layoffs and volatility that plagued the job market in 2022 and 
2023, government jobssuddenly became an attractive alternative 
<https://www.businessinsider.com/federal-state-government-jobs-trending-tiktok-2024-2>
.



Pay in the public sector largely lags behind private-sector jobs, but that’s 
somewhat offset by good benefits, retirement plans, and job stability. Younger 
workers, in particular,don’t seem to mind the tradeoff 
<https://www.businessinsider.com/gen-z-avoiding-layoffs-want-public-sector-goverment-jobs-2024-2>
.



Now they’ll potentially face an environment they were looking to escape, where 
jobs aren’t guaranteed and things can change on a whim.



There could be a silver lining. In October, Musk said he’d consider severance 
packages as much as two years’ pay to help alleviate the transition.



""We just have too many people in the government sector, and they could be more 
productive elsewhere,” Musk said.

It’s crazy hard to train reliable transcription models on speech/audio data since so many nuances go into the data, like accents, pauses, small utterances, murmurs, you name it.

Thanks to AssemblyAI [ https://substack.com/redirect/b0089ac8-e9bc-4d59-8d47-de0320d0dc6e?j=eyJ1IjoiMjQybjE3In0.nnbDVVySFRNCz5hdGhUxTBrs1nlgYhEL64dfJdVh0WY ] for partnering on today’s issue.
A Hands-on Demo of Autoencoders
One can do so many things with Autoencoders:
Dimensionality reduction.
Anomaly detection where if reconstruction error is high, something’s fishy!
Detect multivariate covariate shift, which we discussed here [ https://substack.com/redirect/9c9ab9bf-77ae-4fef-9623-f1f1d9d9dd16?j=eyJ1IjoiMjQybjE3In0.nnbDVVySFRNCz5hdGhUxTBrs1nlgYhEL64dfJdVh0WY ].
Data denoising (clean noisy data by training on noise).
They are simple yet so powerful!
At their core, Autoencoders have two main parts:
Encoder: Compresses the input into a dense representation (latent space).
Decoder: Reconstructs the input from this dense representation.
And the idea is to make the reconstructed output as close to the original input as possible:
On a side note, here's how the denoising autoencoder works:
During training, add random noise to the original input, and train an autoencoder to predict the original input.
During inference, provide a noisy input and the network will reconstruct it.
Coming back to the topic...
Below, let's quickly implement an autoencoder:
We'll use ​ [ https://substack.com/redirect/10d3ee8a-0d5c-4aa9-a7ba-aea7d3a87a2f?j=eyJ1IjoiMjQybjE3In0.nnbDVVySFRNCz5hdGhUxTBrs1nlgYhEL64dfJdVh0WY ]PyTorch Lightning [ https://substack.com/redirect/10d3ee8a-0d5c-4aa9-a7ba-aea7d3a87a2f?j=eyJ1IjoiMjQybjE3In0.nnbDVVySFRNCz5hdGhUxTBrs1nlgYhEL64dfJdVh0WY ] for this.
First, we define our autoencoder!
Next, we define our dataset (MNIST):
Finally, we train the model in two lines of code with ​ [ https://substack.com/redirect/10d3ee8a-0d5c-4aa9-a7ba-aea7d3a87a2f?j=eyJ1IjoiMjQybjE3In0.nnbDVVySFRNCz5hdGhUxTBrs1nlgYhEL64dfJdVh0WY ]PyTorch Lightning [ https://substack.com/redirect/10d3ee8a-0d5c-4aa9-a7ba-aea7d3a87a2f?j=eyJ1IjoiMjQybjE3In0.nnbDVVySFRNCz5hdGhUxTBrs1nlgYhEL64dfJdVh0WY ]​ [ https://substack.com/redirect/10d3ee8a-0d5c-4aa9-a7ba-aea7d3a87a2f?j=eyJ1IjoiMjQybjE3In0.nnbDVVySFRNCz5hdGhUxTBrs1nlgYhEL64dfJdVh0WY ]:
The Lightning Trainer automates 40+ training optimization techniques including:
Epoch and batch iteration
optimizer.step(), loss.backward() etc.
Calling model.eval()
enabling/disabling grads during evaluation
Checkpoint saving and loading
Multi-GPU
16-bit precision.
Since the model has been trained, we can visualize the performance.
Let's encode/decode an image using our trained model below:
Done!
And that's how you train an autoencoder.
As mentioned earlier, autoencoders are incredibly helpful in detecting multivariate covariate shifts.
This is important to address since almost all real-world ML models gradually degrade in performance due to covariate shift.
It is a serious problem because we trained the model on one distribution, but it is being used to predict on another distribution in production.
Autoencoders help in addressing this, and we discussed it here [ https://substack.com/redirect/f34c3038-19dd-4067-a411-59833ec95012?j=eyJ1IjoiMjQybjE3In0.nnbDVVySFRNCz5hdGhUxTBrs1nlgYhEL64dfJdVh0WY ]​ [ https://substack.com/redirect/f34c3038-19dd-4067-a411-59833ec95012?j=eyJ1IjoiMjQybjE3In0.nnbDVVySFRNCz5hdGhUxTBrs1nlgYhEL64dfJdVh0WY ].

**1. Experimental Gemini model hints at what’s next: **A new model has [jumped](https://www.testingcatalog.com/new-ai-model-gemini-experimental-1114-debuts-on-google-ai-studio/) to the top of the lmarena leaderboard (formerly the Lmsys Arena). Gemini-Exp-1114 has OpenAI’s o1 preview model beat and is currently tied with the latest version of GPT-4o. It’s only available to developers for now. But it’s another sign that Gemini 2 could be coming soon, with some speculating that Exp could be a scaled-down version of the long-hyped model.

**2. Elon Musk’s xAI raises another $6B for war chest of Nvidia chips: **Nvidia’s state-of-the-art GPUs are notoriously pricey — and Elon Musk’s xAI needs a lot of them: 100,000, to be exact. The startup looks set to [secure](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/11/15/elon-musks-xai-raising-up-to-6-billion-to-purchase-100000-nvidia-chips-for-memphis-data-center.html) $6B in new funding, with the majority coming from countries in the Middle East. That would put its new valuation at $50B, making it one of the most valuable AI companies around.

**3. The Friend AI necklace is off to a polarizing start: **If you visit the webpage for the buzzy startup Friend, you’ll get matched with one of its chatbots, who might send you an intense message like: “Just got mugged at gunpoint.” Founder [Avi Schiffmann](https://x.com/AviSchiffmann/status/1857096975201570866) says it flips the usual script of going to a chatbot for help, adding that the provocative conversation-starters will make for more entertaining interactions. But some X users reported that their chatbots were unusually hostile — and eventually blocked them altogether.

A landmark advancement in 21st-century science, CRISPR-Cas9 revolutionized our ability to edit genetic code. Now, researchers at Stanford and the nonprofit ARC Institute have developed an AI companion called Evo that uses CRISPR to discover new gene editing strategies, potentially unlocking novel treatments for everything from HIV to cancer to vision loss.

While other models have made big strides in understanding our biological makeup (like AlphaFold, whose inventors took the Nobel Prize in Chemistry this year), Evo has a much larger context window than its peers. That means it can analyze entire genomes, not just parts of them. 

Because it’s so good at understanding the big picture, it can do in minutes what used to take six months to a year, like identifying which genes are vital to an organism’s survival — a crucial step for disease research.

In today’s big story, Microsoft’s massive bet on AI with Copilot has yet to 
live up to the hype 
<https://businessinsider.com/microsoft-ai-artificial-intelligence-bet-doubts-marc-benioff-satya-nadella-2024-11>
, potentially raising alarms for everyone else investing in the space.

The big story


A Copilot conundrum


Microsoft’s challenges with its flagship AI product could be another red flag 
for an industry with high hopes for the tech.



Business Insider’s Ashley Stewart, our resident Microsoft expert, has a deep 
dive on Copilotcoming up short on the big expectations laid out for it 
<https://www.businessinsider.com/microsoft-ai-artificial-intelligence-bet-doubts-marc-benioff-satya-nadella-2024-11>
 when it launched over a year ago.



CEO Satya Nadella didn’t hold back initially, describing Copilot as something 
that would ""fundamentally transform our relationship with technology” when it 
was unveiled.



But internally and among clients, that doesn’t always feel like the case. One 
Microsoft executive told Ashley that Copilot offers useful results about 10% of 
the time.



“The rest of the time it’s: Why do we even try?” they said. 



It’s an unsettling realization considering the stakes of AI. Many companies — 
and arguably the entire US stock market — are banking on generative AI being 
revolutionary. And while Microsoft’s bet on AI dwarfs almost everyone else’s, 
its hangup with the tech is something a company of any size can relate to: Is 
this stuff worth it?



It’s also not the only challenge the generative AI space is navigating.



Reports about OpenAI’s newest AI model struggling to show big improvements 
raised questions about thetech hitting a performance wall 
<https://www.businessinsider.com/openai-orion-model-scaling-law-silicon-valley-chatgpt-2024-11>
. CEO Sam Altman appeared to address it with a cryptic tweet: “there is no wall 
<https://www.businessinsider.com/sam-altman-ai-wall-slowdown-openai-2024-11>.” 



Still, it’s feeding concerns about the timeline for artificial general 
intelligence. AGI is the concept that autonomous computer systems outperform 
humans at most economically valuable work, but it appearsharder to achieve than 
previously anticipated 
<https://www.businessinsider.com/agi-predictions-looking-stretched-openai-sam-altman-google-ai-2024-11>
, writes BI’s Alistair Barr.

 
<https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/ai-stocks-risk-nvidia-gpus-blackwell-tech-outlook-depreciation-accounting-2024-8>

Getty Images; Alyssa Powell/BI


The counterargument is straightforward: It’s still the early innings. 



Microsoft is adamant its Copilot investment is already paying off. Jared 
Spataro, a vice president of marketing for Microsoft 365, pointed Ashley to 
Copilot success stories like Lumen Technologies, which projects $50 million in 
annual savings from its sales team’s use of Copilot.



Some customers aren’t necessarily worried either, as they continue to plow 
money into AI. A Flexera survey found OpenAI ranked fourth among vendors that 
IT leaders plan tospend the most with next year 
<https://www.businessinsider.com/openai-top-vendor-it-leaders-2024-11>. 



But tech players won’t have forever to figure things out. Earlier this year, 
analysts at Barclays highlighted an under-the-radar risk to AI bets:the 
depreciation costs related to AI chips 
<https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/ai-stocks-risk-nvidia-gpus-blackwell-tech-outlook-depreciation-accounting-2024-8>
. As firms look to stock up on GPUs, they run the risk of the tech no longer 
being relevant as new iterations emerge.



And then there’s the possibility of internal drama. Ashley previously reported 
onthe pay disparity at Microsoft 
<https://www.businessinsider.com/microsoft-pay-data-shows-how-much-more-ai-workers-make-2024-8>
 between AI-focused employees and everyone else.



“AI is great and it might be the future, but when are you going to focus on 
your billpayers?” one employee told Ashley.

enthralled.Yipit, a Carlyle-backed provider of credit-card data, filed a 
lawsuit accusing two former salespeople ofstealing intellectual property to use 
in their new roles at rival MScience

1. Elon Musk’s incredible hold on US politics. Politics and money have always 
been intertwined, but the current relationship between the world’s richest man 
and the president-elect is unprecedented. The result is Muskacting almost as a 
shadow president 
<https://www.businessinsider.com/elon-musk-donald-trump-elected-shadow-president-2024-11>
.



2. A potential Trump trade plan beneficiary: US semiconductor jobs. If Trump’s 
proposed trade plan is enacted, the American semiconductor industry could see 
hiring growth. Industry experts told BI that tariffs on foreign-made chipscould 
help level the playing field for US chipmakers 
<https://www.businessinsider.com/trumps-tariffs-chips-could-create-more-american-jobs-increase-prices-2024-11>
, which have faced tough competition from their global counterparts. 



3. The OpenAI mafia swells its ranks. Nearly two dozen former employees have 
left the AI juggernaut and founded startups of their own. The latest defectors 
include OpenAI cofounder and former chief scientist Ilya Sutskever and former

1. Four ways Trump's housing plans could hurt homebuyers and three ways it 
could help. Trump promised to make housing more affordable in part by deporting 
millions of immigrants, slashing construction regulations, and building houses

<https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-high-home-prices-housing-mortgage-rates-deregulation-tariffs-immigration-2024-11>

2. Spirit Airlines has filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. The budget 
airline has struggled since a planned merger with JetBlue was called off in

from groceries, which are predominantly domestic. But Target often relies on

Hi,

Something I’ve noticed about markets is that they have a way of tricking the crowd. Consensus doesn’t have to be wrong, but when sentiment is overwhelmingly positive, that optimism is usually priced in. At that point the incremental buyers - the fuel for further gains - may have run out. Markets don’t need bad news to fall; sometimes they just run out of good news or see expectations delayed.

Right now with the post-U.S. election buzz, I can’t remember a time when so many were convinced it’s a clear positive for markets, particularly U.S. shares. But what if this wave of optimism is met with a vacuum of good news over the next few months? Or if unseen negatives, like inflation or higher interest rates rear their heads in the face of this euphoria? The market narrative is seductive, but when everyone’s bought into the same story it might be time to lean in the other direction.

This is why I believe systematic portfolio rebalancing works so well. It’s not supposed to feel comfortable - in fact it’s designed to be hard. It means cutting risk when everyone else is adding, and adding when everyone else is cutting.

Over the past few months we’ve had a lot of Stockspot clients question the role of government bonds in their portfolios. Ironically that very skepticism is probably the best argument for holding onto them right now.

As always, if you have any questions about our approach or investing in general, feel free to leave me a message here. (https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/AskChris_Stockspot?c=karolbhandari666@gmail.com)

October performance update

Stockspot’s performance for the 12 months to 31 October 2024 remained solid across both the Stockspot Model Portfolios and Sustainable Portfolios. Our five core options (https://www.stockspot.com.au/how-it-works/portfolios/?utm_source=stockspot&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=2024_November_newsletter) delivered returns of 18.7% to 25.5% after fees, while our Sustainable options (https://www.stockspot.com.au/how-it-works/portfolios/?is_sustainable=true#portfolios&utm_source=stockspot&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=2024_November_newsletter) achieved between 20.6% and 28.5%.

Our Topaz Income (https://www.stockspot.com.au/investing-income/?utm_source=stockspot&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=2024_November_newsletter) and Topaz Inflation (https://www.stockspot.com.au/investing-inflation/?utm_source=stockspot&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=2024_November_newsletter) options enjoyed continued strong performance, delivering 12 month after-fee returns of 21.8% and 22.2% respectively.

Gold had an exceptional month, surging 10.5% to a new all-time high, supported in part by a weaker Australian dollar. Since May when I discussed the case for a greater gold allocation in super funds (https://blog.stockspot.com.au/super-funds-wrong-on-gold/?utm_source=stockspot&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=2024_November_newsletter) , gold has risen 19.2% and is up 34.5% for the year - its strongest performance in two decades.

Over ten years the portfolios have returned 6.0% p.a. to 8.8% p.a. after fees.

*Stockspot comparison group including Vanguard diversified funds and Average fund managers is defined by the Morningstar multi-sector asset allocation ranges: Growth (61%-80% growth assets), Balanced (41%-60% growth assets) and Moderate (21%-40% growth assets).

76,The 1774 Novel Blamed for Youth Suicide,Pessimists Archive <pessimistsarchive@substack.com>,"Mon, 18 Nov 2024 05:44:03 +0000","View this post on the web at https://newsletter.pessimistsarchive.org/p/the-1774-novel-blamed-for-youth-suicide

Two hundred and fifty years ago - in 1774 - Johann Wolfgang von Goethe published The Sorrows of Young Werther [ https://substack.com/redirect/af854243-6c9a-498f-8bf8-431baad78641?j=eyJ1IjoiMjQybjE3In0.nnbDVVySFRNCz5hdGhUxTBrs1nlgYhEL64dfJdVh0WY ]. 
The novel unfolds through a series of letters written by its protagonist - Werther - portraying a tale of unrequited love that leads him to ultimately take his own life with a pistol.

The book would quickly become a sensation, first among youths in Germany and then across Europe and the United States after translations emerged. A community grew around the novel, an early ‘fandom’—similar to that of Harry Potter or Twilight—with merchandise and even cosplayers: some youths adopted the sartorial style of the main character donning a blue tailcoat, yellow waistcoat and boots.
New Media
The rapid popularity of the book was dubbed ‘Werther Mania’ - and inevitably made older generations uneasy, particularly religious institutions who admonished it for glorifying suicide.
It should be remembered that novels “constituted the most emotionally powerful medium”  [ https://substack.com/redirect/c7cc4472-19fa-4695-ad57-8171fcfa64dd?j=eyJ1IjoiMjQybjE3In0.nnbDVVySFRNCz5hdGhUxTBrs1nlgYhEL64dfJdVh0WY ]at the time, as the Lancet [ https://substack.com/redirect/c7cc4472-19fa-4695-ad57-8171fcfa64dd?j=eyJ1IjoiMjQybjE3In0.nnbDVVySFRNCz5hdGhUxTBrs1nlgYhEL64dfJdVh0WY ] pointed out, noting “there were no other mass media; no radio, television, cinema, videos, video games.” [ https://substack.com/redirect/c7cc4472-19fa-4695-ad57-8171fcfa64dd?j=eyJ1IjoiMjQybjE3In0.nnbDVVySFRNCz5hdGhUxTBrs1nlgYhEL64dfJdVh0WY ] The book would quickly be scorned and scapegoated, much like those more modern mediums:

Translated Excerpt: “But if we consider this little book from another perspective and reflect on how harmful it could be for certain young men or some girls who might fall in love, who are not able to distinguish between fiction and reality, we would wish that it had never been written.”
The Blame Game
Those early concerns that Werther might encourage suicides created an expectation and elicited confirmation bias. It was only a matter of time before the book would be directly blamed for adolescent tragedy.
The first example of this was in 1778 when Christel von Lassberg, a young Weimar court official's child, died by suicide. The Sorrow of Young Werther was found in her coat pocket leading to obvious conclusions. Goeth gave credence to this conclusion, taking responsibility and promising [ https://substack.com/redirect/fc165ec7-fa5a-4b92-aac2-054b257bac08?j=eyJ1IjoiMjQybjE3In0.nnbDVVySFRNCz5hdGhUxTBrs1nlgYhEL64dfJdVh0WY ] to build a memorial in her honor. 
Possession of the book by victims was treated as causative evidence by grieving families, the media, and the church, despite its common wide ownership among young people. Use of a gun, and motivation by heartbreak were also deemed proof of inspiration by The Sorrows of Young Werther.

Correlation not Causation
In 2023 a study [ https://substack.com/redirect/6cc1ad7e-3aef-48d6-925f-839f73cc97b4?j=eyJ1IjoiMjQybjE3In0.nnbDVVySFRNCz5hdGhUxTBrs1nlgYhEL64dfJdVh0WY ] noted that of the reported suicides blamed on the novel, many of them were attributed using these questionable forms of evidence: 
In the above examples from previous literature, 19 suicides were attributed to the novel between 1755 and 1833. 10 of them were blamed on the novel because the young person simply owned the book. Only 2 could be directly tied to the book. The study also found new examples, with a similar lack of causative evidence. 
These speculations and reporting led to the notion of a ""suicide epidemic,"" prompting bans in Italy, Denmark, and parts of Germany out of an abundance of caution. The reputation stuck.
Guilty Conscious
One author remarked in 1813 that the novel “caused more suicides than the most beautiful woman in the world” and the following year Goethe himself would recount his feelings of culpability for some tragedies, saying: 
“My friends…thought that they must transform poetry into reality, imitate a novel like this in real life and, in any case, shoot themselves; and what occurred at first among a few took place later among the general public…”
This suggests he felt guilt for more than just the death of Christel von Lassberg - but of the larger supposed epidemic. These feelings prompted him to re-release [ https://substack.com/redirect/912c90b5-76dc-40e9-80e4-9624c579ba84?j=eyJ1IjoiMjQybjE3In0.nnbDVVySFRNCz5hdGhUxTBrs1nlgYhEL64dfJdVh0WY ] a slightly toned down version of the novel in 1787.
The Werther Effect
In 1974 the concept of the ‘Werther Effect [ https://substack.com/redirect/423dc996-127f-4c55-8525-c71d160ce61b?j=eyJ1IjoiMjQybjE3In0.nnbDVVySFRNCz5hdGhUxTBrs1nlgYhEL64dfJdVh0WY ]’ was coined by David Philipps, who suggested that reporting on high profile suicides - such as a celebrity or one blamed on a novel - can cause a spike of copycat suicides. Notably this is about reports of real world suicides, not fictional ones.
Assuming Philipps theory is correct, the panicked reporting on ‘The Sorrows of Young Werther’ could have exacerbated any uptick in youth suicides - many of which may well have been wrongly blamed on the novel, reported as such and lead to more coverage and potentially more copycats.
Although even ‘the Werther Effect’ could be just another simplistic answer to a complex issue: youth suicide - and scapegoating media - real or fictional, a distraction from real mitigations.

**Frozen Forest: **Turns out Antarctica wasn’t always a frosty wasteland. Scientists recently [discovered](https://www.sciencealert.com/first-ever-amber-discovered-in-antarctica-shows-rainforest-existed-near-south-pole) amber at the South Pole, a strong indicator that the icy continent housed a swampy rainforest some 92 million years ago. 

**Relative Relativity: **Quantum physics may have hit a [speed bump](https://www.newsweek.com/einstein-general-relativity-gravity-space-time-dark-energy-1984667). Researchers from the University of Geneva measured gravitational distortions and concluded that gravity may, in fact, behave slightly differently from what Einstein’s Theory of Relativity predicts. 

**Meteoric Plot Twist:** An asteroid struck Mars 11 million years ago, flinging chunks of debris towards Earth. Scientists recently [discovered](https://phys.org/news/2024-11-meteorite-evidence-liquid-mars-million.html) the debris may have interacted with liquid water some 742 million years ago.

**Tree Rocket: **Japan just [launched ](https://x.com/BrianRoemmele/status/1854883880802959385)the world’s first wooden satellite into space for a 6-month orbit. Named LignoSat, the satellite is an attempt to earmark wood as a space-grade material. 

**Dr. Robot: **Robots can now learn how to operate on patients by watching surgeons do it first. Researchers from John Hopkins used imitation learning to [train ](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2024/11/241111123037.htm)the da Vinci Surgical System robot to perform surgical procedures with complete autonomy.

Walking the DOGE


Elon Musk made his name and fortune disrupting antiquated industries. Next in 
his sights: Government.



As co-lead of a new Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), he’s charged 
with finding waste in the US government’s$6.75 trillion 
<https://www.businessinsider.com/elon-musk-vivek-ramaswamy-doge-government-efficiency-what-us-spends-2024-11>
 in spending.



The billionaire has approached the task in attention-grabbing fashion. The 
department shares a name with Musk’sfavorite dog meme 
<https://www.businessinsider.com/doge-meme-history-elon-musk-2024-11>. Musk has 
promised a leaderboardtracking ""insanely dumb” government spending 
<https://www.businessinsider.com/elon-musk-doge-leaderboard-federal-government-spending-trump-2024-11>
. 



A JD for the department asks for “super high-IQ small-government 
revolutionaries 
<https://www.businessinsider.com/elon-musk-doge-hiring-staff-how-to-apply-2024-11>
.” Those interested can apply by a direct message on Musk’s social media 
platform X.



Musk has shown himself to be a master cost cutter. His slashing of jobs at 
Twitter inspiredSilicon Valley founders

And Republican control of both chambers of Congress gives Musk’s efforts to 
curtail government 
<https://www.businessinsider.com/why-elon-musk-cutting-federal-spending-could-work-2024-11>
 an advantage over earlier efforts under Presidents Reagan and Clinton.

Tesla’s pay packets


Anyone who accepts a job offer from Tesla must make a wager on the company 
itself, accepting lower base pay up front for the chance of a potentially 
lucrative future payout.



BI secured access to an internal Tesla pay database, revealing the company’s 
high-risk, high-reward system. The pay structure is ultimately part of CEO Elon 
Musk’s quest to hire the most “hardcore” employees.

Dr. Robot will not see you now


The healthcare startup Forward went all in on its AI doc-in-a-box. “If Elon 
has the self-driving car, well, this is the autonomous doctor’s office,” its 
CEO said in 2023.



But after raising $650 million in funding, it's going dark. Forward’s big bet 
— and big loss — on flashy tech shows the perils of AI-fueled style over 
substance.

Goldman’s marketing spree


Goldman’s unveiling of a new logo this year went largely unnoticed by most 
people outside finance. But inside the storied investment bank it left some 
perplexed — and spotlighted the executive behind it: Fiona Carter, the bank’s 
chief marketing officer.



Since joining Goldman in 2020, Carter’s marketing team has made waves, from 
its rapid growth to the spending associated with glitzy sponsorships. Several 
high-ranking officials told BI they questioned the cost and efficacy of the 
bank’s marketing efforts.

A DIY training dilemma


When companies look to cut costs, on-the-job training is an easy place to 
start. The plethora of available tech means new hires can spend a little time 
with a video module, then hit the ground running. Right?



Wrong. The decline of job training means more and more of Corporate America is 
just winging it. Outsourcing training to the robots is a costly mistake that 
comes back to bite in the end.



Too many videos, not enough mentors.

87,Use Box Plots with Caution! They Can Be Misleading.,Daily Dose of Data Science <avichawla@substack.com>,"Sat, 16 Nov 2024 19:07:50 +0000","View this post on the web at https://blog.dailydoseofds.com/p/use-box-plots-with-caution-they-can-e9b

Box plots are pretty common in data analysis.
Yet, they can be highly misleading at times.
Let’s understand how!
To begin, a box plot is a graphical representation of just five numbers:
min
first quartile
median
third quartile
max
This means that if two entirely different distributions have similar five values, they will produce identical box plots, as depicted below:
As depicted above, three datasets have the same box plots, but entirely different distributions.
This shows that solely looking at a bar plot may lead to incorrect or misleading conclusions.
Here, the takeaway is not that box plots should not be used.
Instead, the takeaway is that whenever we generate any summary statistic, we lose essential information.
Thus, always look at the underlying data distribution.
For instance, whenever I create a box plot, I create a violin (or KDE) plot too. This lets me validate whether summary statistics resonate with the data distribution.
In fact, I also find Raincloud plots to be pretty useful.
They provide a pretty concise way to combine and visualize three different types of plots together:
Box plots for data statistics.
Strip plots for data overview.
KDE plots for the probability distribution of data.
Impressive, isn't it?
That said…
Building end-to-end projects has taught me MANY invaluable technical lessons and cautionary measures, which I hardly found anyone talking about explicitly.
I covered 8 more pitfalls and cautionary measures here: ​ [ https://substack.com/redirect/4b1efe40-dbc4-48e9-a38e-43c62ce90e2e?j=eyJ1IjoiMjQybjE3In0.nnbDVVySFRNCz5hdGhUxTBrs1nlgYhEL64dfJdVh0WY ]8 Fatal (Yet Non-obvious) Pitfalls and Cautionary Measures in Data Science [ https://substack.com/redirect/4b1efe40-dbc4-48e9-a38e-43c62ce90e2e?j=eyJ1IjoiMjQybjE3In0.nnbDVVySFRNCz5hdGhUxTBrs1nlgYhEL64dfJdVh0WY ].
Moreover, I have seen that many ML engineers quickly pivot to building a different model when they don't get satisfying results with one kind of model.
They do not fully exploit the possibilities of existing models and continue to move towards complex ones.
However, after building so many ML models, I have learned various techniques that uncover nuances and optimizations we could apply to significantly enhance model performance without necessarily increasing the model complexity.
I shared 11 such high-utility techniques here: ​ [ https://substack.com/redirect/fa6c1846-0144-48e5-95a6-36665e95a578?j=eyJ1IjoiMjQybjE3In0.nnbDVVySFRNCz5hdGhUxTBrs1nlgYhEL64dfJdVh0WY ]11 Powerful Techniques To Supercharge Your ML Models [ https://substack.com/redirect/fa6c1846-0144-48e5-95a6-36665e95a578?j=eyJ1IjoiMjQybjE3In0.nnbDVVySFRNCz5hdGhUxTBrs1nlgYhEL64dfJdVh0WY ].

Big-O Notation in 3 Minutes
How do AirTags work?
AirTags work by leveraging a combination of Bluetooth technology and the vast network of Apple devices to help you locate your lost items. 
Here's a breakdown of how they function: 
Bluetooth Signal: Each AirTag emits a secure Bluetooth signal that can be detected by nearby Apple devices (iPhones, iPads, etc.) within the Find My network. 
Find My Network: When an AirTag comes within range of an Apple device in the Find My network, that device anonymously and securely relays the AirTag's location information to iCloud. 
Location Tracking: You can then use the Find My app on your own Apple device to see the approximate location of your AirTag on a map. 
Limitations: 
Please note that AirTags rely on Bluetooth technology and the presence of Apple devices within the Find My network. If your AirTag is in an area with few Apple devices, its location may not be updated as frequently or accurately.

Launch Alert: pgai Vectorizer automates embedding creation in PostgreSQL, keeping your embeddings up to date as your data changes—no manual syncing required. You can also test models, switch seamlessly, and manage everything with SQL. Available free on GitHub or fully managed in Timescale Cloud.
What is a deadlock? 
A deadlock occurs when two or more transactions are waiting for each other to release locks on resources they need to continue processing. This results in a situation where neither transaction can proceed, and they end up waiting indefinitely. 
Coffman Conditions 
The Coffman conditions, named after Edward G. Coffman, Jr., who first outlined them in 1971, describe four necessary conditions that must be present simultaneously for a deadlock to occur: 
Mutual Exclusion 
Hold and Wait 
No Preemption 
Circular Wait 
Deadlock Prevention 
Resource ordering: impose a total ordering of all resource types, and require that each process requests resources in a strictly increasing order. 
Timeouts: A process that holds resources for too long can be rolled back. 
Banker’s Algorithm: A deadlock avoidance algorithm that simulates the allocation of resources to processes and helps in deciding whether it is safe to grant a resource request based on the future availability of resources, thus avoiding unsafe states. 
 
Deadlock Recovery 
Selecting a victim: Most modern Database Management Systems (DBMS) and Operating Systems implement sophisticated algorithms for detecting deadlocks and selecting victims, often allowing customization of the victim selection criteria via configuration settings. The selection can be based on resource utilization, transaction priority, cost of rollback etc. 
Rollback: The database may roll back the entire transaction or just enough of it to break the deadlock. Rolled-back transactions can be restarted automatically by the database management system. 
Over to you: have you solved any tricky deadlock issues?
How Do Search Engines Work?
Search engines work through a combination of three core processes: 
Crawling: Search engines use automated programs called ""crawlers"" to discover and download web pages from the internet. These crawlers start with a list of known web pages (seeds) and follow links on those pages to find new ones, creating a vast network of interconnected content. 
Indexing: The information collected by the crawlers is then analyzed and organized into a massive database called an index. This process involves extracting key elements such as keywords, content type, freshness, language, and other classification signals to understand what each page is about and how relevant it might be to different search queries. 
Serving search results: When a user enters a query, the search engine's algorithm sifts through the index to identify the most relevant and helpful pages. Here's a breakdown of how it works:
Query Analysis: The search engine analyzes the user's query to understand its meaning and intent. This includes identifying keywords, recognizing synonyms, and interpreting context. 
Retrieval: The search engine retrieves relevant pages from its vast index based on the query analysis. This involves matching the query's keywords with the indexed content of web pages. 
Ranking: The retrieved pages are then ranked based on their relevance and other factors.

Dispatch


Meet 'No Meet Week'


Last year, I told my reports that I was taking every non-essential meeting off 
my calendar for a week. I’d call it No Meet Week and use that time to catch up 
on my ever-growing to-do list, ideate, and edit.



I hate meetings — and I say this as an extroverted people person. 



I’m not alone. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang doesn’t have one-on-ones 
<https://www.businessinsider.com/nvidia-jensen-huang-management-leadership-advice-how-to-run-business-2024-6>
 with his direct reports. Also, a2023 Microsoft survey 
<https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/worklab/work-trend-index/will-ai-fix-work> 
that analyzed data from 31,000 workers from 31 countries found that inefficient 
meetings were the No. 1 hindrance to their productivity, pointing to 68% of 
respondents who said they don’t have enough time to focus during their workdays.



I get it: On average, I spend about 18.3 hours a week in meetings, or nearly 
half my workday.



Still, that doesn’t quite capture how much meeting culture shapes my job. As 
an active participant, I’m often preparing for the meeting, in the meeting, and 
then do several follow-ups after the meeting, ballooning the experience into an 
official time suck.



After I introduced No Meet Week to my team, one manager said she’d like to 
participate too, and soon, I extended it to my entire team.



What resulted was a boon to morale and overall productivity — not just for 
that week but throughout the rest of the year. Managers started to question if 
meetings were still a good use of time and came up with other more efficient 
ways to communicate in our hybrid newsroom.

The coming reign of the only child


Only children have long been viewed as something of a demographic outlier, and 
are often stereotyped as spoiled or unable to play well with others. And for 
many Americans, they’re viewed as the least desired family outcome when 
thinking about their dream lives.



But siblingless families are on the rise — and it’s not hard to see why. Women 
are having children later in life, and the cost of raising a kid has rapidly 
increased. But in a country more divided than ever, the only child’s social 
skills, idiosyncrasies, and family dynamics might be what we need to thrive in 
modern life.


Why only children might be our only hope

Quitting protein powder


As a fitness and nutrition reporter, Business Insider’s Rachel Hosie never 
paid close attention to the ultra-processed foods she ate. Instead, she focused 
mostly on getting enough protein and fiber in her diet.



But as more studies began pointing to the health risks of ultra-processed 
foods, she decided to rethink her UPF choices. For one week, Hosie attempted to 
hit her daily protein goal of 110 to 130 grams without consuming 
ultra-processed foods like protein bars.


Here’s what she learned

What’s that smell?


The fragrance industry is booming, becoming the fastest-growing category 
within the beauty market. Not only are teenagers getting in on the craze, but 
men are among fragrance’s top consumers.



BI spoke to successful men across different industries to learn about their 
favorite colognes. Fragrances from luxury brands like Jean Paul Gaultier were a 
top choice, especially in the finance world.



Here are their picks

Staying in the Serengeti


At the edge of Serengeti National Park in Tanzania is TAASA, a luxury safari 
lodge. BI's Monica Humphries stayed in one of their 540-square-foot tents — 
which, by the way, go for $985 a person.



The lodge boasts 180-degree views of the surrounding nature, an infinity pool 
overlooking a valley, and a host of luxury amenities. That’s not even the best 
part.

94,Why Some Marketers Are Better Than You,Digital Deepak <digitaldeepakblog@substack.com>,"Sat, 16 Nov 2024 09:52:40 +0000","View this post on the web at https://blog.digitaldeepak.com/p/why-some-marketers-are-better-than

You’ve probably seen them. The digital marketers who seem to be miles ahead - the ones getting consistent results, landing bigger clients, and pulling off successful campaigns one after another.
It’s easy to look at those people and wonder: What do they know that I don’t?
If you’ve ever felt that way, you’re not alone. Many marketers wonder if their competitors are simply more talented, more experienced, or have access to some secret resource. 
But here’s the truth: The difference between average and successful marketers isn’t talent. It’s the ability to see the bigger picture.
Your competitors aren’t necessarily better. They’ve just mastered something most marketers overlook. They understand how each stage of the marketing funnel connects. They know how every piece of the funnel - from awareness to conversion - fits together to build momentum and maximize results.
And that makes all the difference. Why full-funnel understanding is a game-changer. Let’s understand why this knowledge separates the top players from everyone else.
Most marketers work on individual tactics. They know how to create ads, build email sequences, or post content on social media. And they’re good at those individual pieces.
But here’s where things often go wrong. They’re missing the connections between these steps.  Without seeing how one stage of the funnel feeds into the next, their results end up fragmented—good but not great. 
They might get a burst of engagement from an ad or a strong open rate on an email, but they struggle to create a cohesive experience that consistently moves people from interest to action.
On the other hand, competitors who understand the full funnel have the advantage of clarity. They know how to attract people, keep them engaged, and lead them to a decision. 
It’s like having a map - you’re not guessing where to go next; you know the exact path to guide your audience through so they arrive at the final destination: conversion.
This is why some marketers keep getting results while others keep guessing. They’re not relying on isolated wins. They’re using a full-funnel system where each piece builds on the next, giving them control over the process and delivering results they can count on.
How can you start applying this to your own strategy?
Let’s do a quick exercise to help you spot gaps and opportunities in your funnel. This will give you a sense of where you might be leaving results on the table.
Map Out Your Funnel Stages: Take a moment to think about your current strategy. Can you clearly identify each stage of your funnel? For instance:
How are you bringing in leads (top of the funnel)?
How are you engaging and nurturing those leads (middle of the funnel)?
And what are you doing to guide them to a decision (bottom of the funnel)?
Look for Connections: Now, consider how each stage connects. Are your ads driving traffic to a landing page that aligns with the ad's message? Does your email sequence follow up with the right message based on where the lead came from? If any of these steps feel disconnected, that’s an area to improve.
Identify Drop-Off Points: Finally, look for areas where leads might fall off. Are they clicking your ad but not engaging with the landing page? Are they opening emails but not taking the next step? These drop-off points are clues that something isn’t connecting, and they’re often where small adjustments can lead to big gains.
Seeing the bigger picture in action
Let’s bring this idea to life with a quick example.
Imagine a marketer who’s running a Facebook ad campaign. She knows her audience is interested in productivity, so she creates a lead magnet offering productivity tips. She runs the ads and gets clicks. Great start, right?
But here’s where her competitors might take things further. They’re not just stopping at the lead magnet. They’re thinking through the journey that comes next. They know their leads need nurturing, so they’ve set up a follow-up email sequence designed to address pain points, build trust, and keep that lead moving through the funnel.
When the lead hits the landing page, they’re greeted with a consistent message aligned perfectly with the ad. The following emails don’t just drop in with random content—they’re strategic, designed to answer questions, overcome objections, and guide the reader to the final step: making a decision.
That’s the power of a full-funnel approach. It’s not about hoping a lead will stick around. It’s about guiding them through each step with intention and clarity.
Cheers,
Deepak Kanakaraju

Question: My father is no more. He has left a big credit card bill which I am not able to pay because I am studying in 11th class only and my mother is not well educated to do a job. What should I do?

Correlation on Ordinal Data
If your correlation analysis includes ordinal features (those with a natural encoding, like t-shirt size, grade, etc.)...
...the choice of encoding can largely affect the correlation results.
For instance, consider this dataset.
Here, we have:
An ordinal categorical feature: t-shirt size (S, M, L, XL).
A continuous feature: weight.
The graph above shows a monotonic relationship between the two features.
If we use Pearson correlation (as shown below), the choice of encoding determines the actual correlation value:
In the left plot, we have this encoding → S(1), M(2), L(3) and XL(4).
In the right plot, we have this encoding → S(1), M(2), L(4) and XL(8).
However, using Spearman correlation solves this issue:
This time, the correlation value is the same.
This happens because the Spearman correlation is rank-based.
In other words, since it operates on the “ranks” of the data, it is more suitable for such cases of correlation analysis.
Using Spearman correlation is pretty simple. If you are using Pandas, just specify the desired correlation measure as follows:
That said, there’s one more thing to take care of when you are training ML models to predict ordinal categorical data.
Ordinal datasets are quite prevalent in the industry, and typical classification models almost always produce suboptimal results in such cases.
With special attention and techniques, however, one can not only add more interpretability to ML models but also produce more accurate machine learning models.
We covered them in detail here: You Are Probably Building Inconsistent Classification Models Without Even Realizing [ https://substack.com/redirect/66fdda97-3a6e-4c84-bfd6-e585eba9b9e3?j=eyJ1IjoiMjQybjE3In0.nnbDVVySFRNCz5hdGhUxTBrs1nlgYhEL64dfJdVh0WY ].
👉 Over to you: What are some other measures to determine the correlation between categorical data and continuous data?
